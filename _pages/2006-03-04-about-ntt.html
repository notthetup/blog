<p>ChinPen == Chinmay Pendharkar. And this is my Core Dump. A place to dump my core.</p>
<p>I’m a developer from Singapore. I focus on Audio Technologies.</p>
<p>I blog about things that I am interested in and things that excite me. These generally are geeky things like Audio/Acoustics, Web Technologies, Security, Embedded systems and Hardware, and Technology in general. I do blog sometimes about Music, and Food, which are my other passions. These days since I am involved in local developer community, I tend to blog about that too. Otherwise there’s much musings about life in general. The archives will give you a glimpse in the happenings in the past.</p>
<p>Find out <a href="http://chinpen.net/">more about me and my projects.</a></p>
