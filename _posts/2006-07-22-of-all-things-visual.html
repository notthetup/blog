<p>I have said this many time, and I say it again. I am <strong>NOT</strong> a visual person. More precisely, I can't be bothered with the visual side of most things. Not that I have total apathy to it, I just feel that there are other things more important than the visual aspect. (And by that I mean the <em>audio</em> aspect..:p)</p>
<p>Anyway, so this post <strong>is</strong> about all things visual.</p>
<p><strong>Camera.</strong></p>
<p>I was never a photographer. My brother always makes fun of my photos and I never had the patience to take artistic shot. I also don't have the 'eye' for photography. Thus, my photos are generally informational, or just symbological for myself. More for my own memory or muse. Point being, I never owned a great camera. I had a Canon <a HREF="http://alpha03.c-wss.com/inc/ApplServlet?SV=WWUCA900">Poweshot A310</a>. It was cheap, simple and did what I wanted it to do. Sadly, it decided to <strong>die</strong> on me. So now I am camera-less.</p>
<p>I have decided not to replace it. At least for the next few months. I don't plan to go on any trips, I am low on savings and I will be pretty busy once I get a job.. (speaking about that....). So I shall refrain from photography untill futher notice.</p>
<p><strong>Flickr</strong></p>
<p>Since I was introduced to flickr a few months ago, I have become a fan. Its the easiest way to get a shot of <em>inferiority-complex</em>. All I can say is people are good.. and people are free!!</p>
<p>I use flickr as more of a sharing tool. So I will upload all the photos, that I should be sharing (Pune, Marriage, Convocation....et al)to my flickr. Go check it out <a HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nttup/">here</a>. Add me as a friend and then you will be able to see most of my photos.:p</p>
<p><strong>Printer</strong></p>
<p>My printer, Canon <a HREF="http://alpha03.c-wss.com/inc/ApplServlet?SV=WWUCA900">i550</a>, died as well. Well the head is dead, which costs like 90% of whole thing. I will probably get a new one. I am looking at the Canon <a HREF="http://site-sg.canon-asia.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bubblejet&amp;prod_type=ip1200">iP1200</a>. Seems like a cheap, small and good printer. I don't need to print photos and all. Just a simple printer to get my documents and stuff printed. And for my mom for her notes and all.</p>
<p>So much for the visual stuff.. Ligths off..:p</p>
