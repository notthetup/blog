<p>OK. I think, I have contemplated on this long enough. I need a teacher! I want someone to teach me music. Specifically, I want someone to teach me about <strong>'Western Classical Music'</strong>. But, don't get me wrong, I don't want to learn the <strong>Piano</strong>, or the <strong>Guitar</strong>. I want to learn <strong>music</strong>. I don't mind if I am taught using a Piano, or the Guitar. But, I don't want to learn the fingerings and the techniques for either.</p>
<p>All this started, when I was making the MIDI for one of my courses last sem. I had to compose a MIDI lasting for a minute. I <em>'made'</em> a tune based on Raag Miya-Malhar. Check it out here...:P But it lacks something. I realised that, it was the Harmony. Thanks to the lack of my knowledge of cords and other harmonic devices, my composition, if you call it that, was very bland. I tried to put some in. But it still sucks. That was when I realised that I needed to know more of these things.</p>
<p>But, I kept on contemplating. I had tried to learn Piano, when I was younger, but had a difficult time trying to read the <em>score</em> and play at the same time. Further, I also had problems controlling my left hand. I then discontinued because of other reasons. Anyway, so I don't want to learn the Piano, or the Guitar, because it will take a lot of time (a whole lot more for stupid old me..) before I'll come to the stage where I can learn about composition and stuff...</p>
<p>The other day, I was tinkering around with a sequencer, <strong>pd</strong> and my old keyboard synth when I sort of made a MIDI of an old melody. I won't upload it cos it <strong>really sucks</strong>. But, thatâ€™s when I realised that I need to learn music, so I could make something more appealing more satisfying..</p>
<p>So..I want to learn about harmony and the various devices used to create it. I want to learn about musical structures and their uses. Cords and progressions. Styles of music and their basis. Various composers and their styles and specialities.</p>
<p><strong>Anyone willing to teach me all that</strong>?? Leave a message on the Tag board..</p>
