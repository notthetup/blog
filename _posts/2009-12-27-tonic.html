<p>This track by the Midival Punditz called Tonic is stuck in my head..</p>
<p>As I did before.. I don't know the lyrics of this track. But I am gonna jot it down as much as I can understand. (Hopefully someone will help me <a href="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/04/28/136/">like last time</a>.. :$:$)</p>
<p><strong>Tonic</strong></p>
<p><em>Tadpey, Bin balam, mora jiya.<br />
Bin nahi chain, rain nahi neendiya<br />
Tadap Tadap ke, bhor kiya.<br />
Tadpey, Bin balam, mora jiya.</em></p>
<p>Back together third disk massive forever<br />
Swinging Delhi on the map and all you cats know that<br />
Gand me ?? mo********er like my beats real fat<br />
My ancestory is partial to getting marshal, I bring it to the now,<br />
I keep my eyes on my opponent, even when I bow.<br />
World class Artistery, deadly profeciency.<br />
Main Kudiyon ka vada, jee I am nahin baat akeli<br />
tu hi best disco dancer no 1. ekdam<br />
sabki loud ladkiya naram garam<br />
mien jab se paida hu ??? shivam say boom beem delhi soon<br />
staying high, flying low, staying hot and keeping cool<br />
just like a warrior with a sharp trishul<br />
the slick spot, the subsonic sureshot<br />
i do what i must, puff, a week of cuss<br />
i roll black charas<br />
tum chaho ??? tu chahe jo samajhlo, bro<br />
by now you know my flow, so blow the shankh<br />
mera joota mere hai jannat ke pankha<br />
great work scala, main hun nache wala<br />
in my gulli ruppes beat the dolla!!!</p>
<p>-Midival Punditz</p>
