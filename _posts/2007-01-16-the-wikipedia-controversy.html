<p>Wikipedia has been in the news recently. Their<a HREF="http://fundraising.wikimedia.org/"> attempts to raise funds</a> were successful, with people donating anything from 80c to US$286800. Currently,  they have raised US$1.018M!!!</p>
<p>Wikipedia uses the idea of collective wisdom to create an amazing amount of content on the web. The <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">latest numbers</a> show around 1,585,075 articles hosted for the English wikipedia, with close to 60,000 hits a day.</p>
<p>With its immense popularity, and its <strong>radical model</strong> of generating the articles, many questions have been raised about it, specifically related to its <strong>Reliability</strong> as an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The formost being <strong>accuracy</strong> of the information inside the articles. Since the writers are not necessarily subject matters experts, or scholars, how can one be sure of accuracy of any information given?</p>
<p>Further more, the open editing model, allows the negative elements of the society to <strong>alter</strong> the information to mislead the users or slander others. There have been many <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curry#Wikipedia">cases of this</a>.</p>
<p>The coverage of wikipedia is often <strong>biased</strong> towards technology, with articles often lacking content, or ill-edited articles on other subjects. The <strong>neutrality</strong> of the authors of the articles cannot be guaranteed, thus generating many articles skewed toward a certain perspective.</p>
<p>As a result if this controversy,  Academics do not consider Wikipedia as a valid source or reference. Schools and Universities do not encourage students to use Wikipedia to do their research and studies.</p>
<p>While there are many who put a lot of efforts to <strong>collect</strong> and <strong>curate</strong> much of the information known to mankind, the small number of those who work against it, are stopping such a great resource from being used to its greatest potential.</p>
