I have always loved libraries. All the books, all the potential for learning, understanding new things, picking up new ideas, concepts and arts, never fails to make me excited. I used to read a lot when I was young, but as I got older, I started having lesser and lesser time to read, and so did my visits to libraries.

The first time I came to [library@esplanade][0] was to attend a live concert of a local band [Lunarin][1]. That's when I made a mental note to come back to this place. It was such a lovely place.

So when I found out that one of the books I needed to borrow was only available there, I decided to spend the afternoon reading and 'working' from the library.

And, as I found out, this place is really amazing.

(AND I really need to get a camera.)

The view of the Marina Bay and Singapore skyline is **stunning **as always. And it's an inspiring sight when you take your eyes out of your book and look out of the window.

The library is dedicated to the Arts. There are many book, CDs, DVD about various types of arts. And the library is classified by Music, Dance, Theatre, Film, et al.

Being surrounded by all these works of artistic academia, I always get motivated to explore my own artistic side (just realized that I do have one!!). Start a new creative project.. take up something different and new.

I love the place.. And I will be hanging out there as much as I can.
