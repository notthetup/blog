<p>Alright...</p>
<p>Seems that our <a HREF="http://www.ladyada.net/make/minty/">Minty Mp3 </a>player project will happen afterall. Currently, we have all the 'raw materials' including the PCBs and all the ICs and components. We just need some good soldering tools (which I hope to buy) and some good debugging tools like multimeter and oscilloscope (which I hope I wont have to buy...).</p>
<p>Oh and the most important, the PIC programmer. We actually built a <a HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~botronics/index/pickey.html">Pic-Key</a>. But I am not so sure if it works. Plus, we dont have any extra PICs to burn...:p Whats worst <a HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=64">Microchip </a>has stopped sampling many PICs... So there is no way to get the PICs other than buying... :"(</p>
<p>Anyway, just the other day I found this. <a HREF="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9">PIC-PG1.</a> Its by sparkfun, and its only US$ 11 + shipping. Seems a better alternative to our Pic-Key..</p>
<p>And I also found Eagle3D. <a HREF="http://www.cadsoft.de/">Eagle </a>is a really great circuit CAD tool that I have been using since I took EE3208. Really good for all student projects. It can produce gerber files so that you can fab the PCB at any fab. I am pretty sure it will work in the NUS PCB fab as well. It takes a little time to learn, but once you get it, its really cool. Its <strong>free</strong> and you can create your own device if the libraries don't have the one you want. And do check their libraries, cos they have many many user submissions....</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.matwei.de/doku.php?id=en:eagle3d:eagle3d">Eagle3D </a>is like a macro for Eagle that allows you convert your Eagle Board layout into a 3D rendering capable file format, through a Eagle ULP. Really cool stuff. The generated file can be viewed through <a HREF="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a>. I did a quick rendeing for Minty, and here are the results.</p>
<p>This is the board layout of Minty...</p>

<p>And this is the 3D version. Cool huh??</p>
<p>Now only if I had more time.....</p>
