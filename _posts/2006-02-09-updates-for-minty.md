Alright.

Seems that our [Minty Mp3 ][0]player project will happen afterall. Currently, we have all the 'raw materials' including the PCBs and all the ICs and components. We just need some good soldering tools (which I hope to buy) and some good debugging tools like multimeter and oscilloscope (which I hope I wont have to buy.).

Oh and the most important, the PIC programmer. We actually built a [Pic-Key][1]. But I am not so sure if it works. Plus, we dont have any extra PICs to burn.:p Whats worst [Microchip ][2]has stopped sampling many PICs. So there is no way to get the PICs other than buying. :"(

Anyway, just the other day I found this. [PIC-PG1.][3] Its by sparkfun, and its only US$ 11 + shipping. Seems a better alternative to our Pic-Key.

And I also found Eagle3D. [Eagle ][4]is a really great circuit CAD tool that I have been using since I took EE3208. Really good for all student projects. It can produce gerber files so that you can fab the PCB at any fab. I am pretty sure it will work in the NUS PCB fab as well. It takes a little time to learn, but once you get it, its really cool. Its **free** and you can create your own device if the libraries don't have the one you want. And do check their libraries, cos they have many many user submissions.

[Eagle3D ][5]is like a macro for Eagle that allows you convert your Eagle Board layout into a 3D rendering capable file format, through a Eagle ULP. Really cool stuff. The generated file can be viewed through [POV-Ray][6]. I did a quick rendeing for Minty, and here are the results.

This is the board layout of Minty.

And this is the 3D version. Cool huh?

Now only if I had more time...
