<p>I have always loved libraries. All the books, all the potential for learning, understanding new things, picking up new ideas, concepts and arts, never fails to make me excited. I used to read a lot when I was young, but as I got older, I started having lesser and lesser time to read, and so did my visits to libraries.</p>
<p>The first time I came to <a href="http://www.pl.sg/PL.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=PlLibraryLocations_1_2&amp;PlLibraryLocations_1_2_actionOverride=%2FIBMS%2FplLibraryLocations%2FlibraryDetailsDisplay&amp;PlLibraryLocations_1_2BranchCode=EPCL&amp;_pageLabel=PlLibraryBranches">library@esplanade</a> was to attend a live concert of a local band <a href="http://www.lunarin.com/">Lunarin</a>. That's when I made a mental note to come back to this place. It was such a lovely place.</p>
<p>So when I found out that one of the books I needed to borrow was only available there, I decided to spend the afternoon reading and 'working' from the library.</p>
<p>And, as I found out, this place is really amazing.</p>

<p>The view of the Marina Bay and Singapore skyline is <strong>stunning </strong>as always. And it's an inspiring sight when you take your eyes out of your book and look out of the window.</p>
<p>The library is dedicated to the Arts. There are many book, CDs, DVD about various types of arts. And the library is classified by Music, Dance, Theatre, Film... et al.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by all these works of artistic academia, I always get motivated to explore my own artistic side (just realized that I do have one!!). Start a new creative project.. take up something different and new...</p>
<p>I love the place.. And I will be hanging out there as much as I can...</p>
