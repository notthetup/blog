<p>OK. So after a reallly long and boring flight I am finally here.<br />
The movies were crappy, the screen resolution absolutely sucked.<br />
They took out most of the cool games from the games selection.<br />
The food was OK, but 3 meals in 16hrs is too much, esp. if all you do is to sit and/or sleep.</p>
<p>I remember I had once(when I was like 5-6) <strike>wowed</strike> vowed that I would never travel to US, unless there was a faster way to go there. Sigh....I should keep more promises.....</p>
<p>Anyway, so at LA, I had like a 7hrs wait for the next flight. That was long, boring and at the end the flight was delayed...&amp;*^@#%^&amp;</p>
<p>I was sleep, bored, hungry and desperatly trying to keep awake. So I decided to indulge in a large cup of pure all-American capitalism....:P:P</p>
<p>(Insert image of Starbucks Coffee)</p>
<p>OK. So I was really bored.</p>
<p>The nice thing though was when I saw this.</p>

<p>The wonders of technology. Not that its anything new, but I felt the power of technology when I realised that I was in touch with anyone and everyone I knew through this peice of tech... Amazing isn&#39;t it? Just bring it there and it works!! Seems pretty simple at first, but then when u think of all the mechanisms that have to work for this to happen, it just great.Long live technology....</p>
<p>More updates from a very laid back trip to Pheonix soon.....</p>
