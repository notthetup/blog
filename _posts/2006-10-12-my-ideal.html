<p>I was looking through some old stuff 2day, when I remebered an old acquiantance. Well, not that old, but I got to know him 2 years back. He was the vice-head of the lab where I did my 1st internship...He is soo cool.. Basically, he is everything that I ever wanted to be!</p>
<p>He's freaking brilliant.. He was getting his PhD when I was there..His general knowledge is amazing... His command over English is also awesome... He cooks and loves to bake!! He's into crazy things like skydiving (I so wanna do that), bungee jumping and all.. And he's a certified rescue diver.. He's very inspring and still very simple and <em>down to earth</em>...</p>
<p>On the technical side, he has a huge amount of knowledge, from pure mathematics, to network protocols and general tech stuff.. He works on a Mac! And he's able to communicate at all levels of a computer system...Which I respect in any person, for very few people understand technology at a multitude of levels.</p>
<p>Another cool thing is he is the right amount of modern and right amount of traditional mixed up. Love people who can understand the new and the old, and take the best of both... Oh.. and one more thing... He's Marathi!!..:D</p>
<p>One day.. I aspire to be like him!!! One day.. Sigh..</p>
