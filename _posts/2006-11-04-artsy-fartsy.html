<p>I was never an artsy person. I think the main reason is that I am not very creative, atleast in the artistic sense. I used to really suck at Arts in primary and secondary school.</p>
<p>I remember my father used to proudly claim, "My son's drawing is really bad. When he draws animals, I tell him to write the name of animal he's trying to draw. Lest the teacher think he was drawing a donkey, while he was drawing a cat"</p>
<p>Thus was my childhood till JC. University started off along the same lines. But luckily I never had to take any hardcore Arts course since JC. :D</p>
<p>However, somewhere from 3rd year of Uni, it all began to change. I was always interested in music, but I began to explore different types of music. Although, my interst in music was never purely artistic/aesthetic, it was more scientific.</p>
<p>Slowly, I started to appreciate other artsy stuff, like photography, design, paintings. What's wierd is, all this happened around the same time my interest in geeky stuff grew.</p>
<p>I still suck at painting and photography. But, atleast now I appreciate good one, and take interest in looking at them.</p>
<p>The nice thing about living in Singapore, is the plethora of great concerts, exibitions, and events that are held related to the arts. Things like WOMAD, Binneial Singapore and the Singapore Arts Festival allows me to feed my artsy side with some great content.</p>
