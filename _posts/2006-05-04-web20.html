<p>As a part of the fringe benefits of doing my <strong>FYP</strong> in <a href="http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/">I2R</a>, I got to attend many interesting seminars and talks there. Just attended one on Web2.0 today. Very simple, very straight forward, and very interesting.</p>
<p>Reminds me of <a href="http://uzyn.com/">a blog post</a> from a friend..:p</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a nice<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2.0"> long article</a> on it.</p>
<p>A few points I took home..</p>
<ul>
<li>All the Web2.0 applications are content driven. The technology allows people to share and access the content easily. Itâ€™s just the means.</li>
<li>Lower hardware costs are major driving forces for the Web2.0 'boom'.</li>
<li><strong>Mashups</strong> (linking multiple available services to create newer, more useful, services) go a long way..</li>
<li>Look at alternate sources of revenue..</li>
<li>Finally..All you need is a simple idea.... The technologies and support is there. If you do it right, your start-up can also be bought by Google at $2m+++ ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Ideas???</p>
