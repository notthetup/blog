<p>Update:</p>
<p>Like I said, all are <strong>welcome</strong> to attend the presentation. ECE has confirmed that the lab will be open that day from <strong>9am</strong> onwards, and there will be few more presentations before mine. You can catch them also.</p>
<p>As for my presentation, I have a little advice..<em> Come with an open mind, have lots of imagination, and most importantly, <strong>ask questions</strong>!!<br />
</em></p>
