<p><font COLOR="#800000">A chat with a good friend, a <a HREF="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">post in a blog</a>, a speech by a fellow <a HREF="http://nus.freetoasthost.info/">Toastmaster</a>, and a long bus ride home. </font></p>
<p>They all seemed to say the same thing to me. Like Jobs said, "<em>If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today</em>?"</p>
<p>The answer has been <em><strong>"NO"</strong></em> for so many days! I should really change something.</p>
<p>I have always believed in <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2006/02/27/life/">living life without any regrets</a>, and yet now I have some.</p>
<p>With this perspective, what seems really stupid is the really long ToDo list I have, which I have been trying to reduce, to no avail. I always say, "<em>One day I will do this</em>."<br />
One day.... Hopefully the day arrives, before everything is lost!</p>
