<p>Isn't this the best part of life?? The onslaught of emotions.. Knowing that you are probably getting what you have wanted for the last 3 years, but with a tinge of uncertainty, and a whole lot of confusion about what I want, and where I will be going, and what this implies..</p>
<p>I guess this is where my immaturity comes into the picture.. I don't have the confidence required to say things I need to.. The same question bother me again and again.... and kill my confidence...</p>
<p>Really? What is it that I have that others don't that will make her like me? I know it's a very typical guys question, but I can't get over it. It's not about trust... really it's not.. I trust her blindly... it's more my own lack of confidence.. I am just an average guy.. sometimes below average.. :)</p>
<p>I do agree that the most difficult part of truly falling in love is to expose the most vulnerable side of myself to someone whom I barely know. Trusting her to take care of it... Dealing with the fact that if it doesn't work out, it will be a blow right where it would hurt the most... Maybe it is indeed easier to not get involved at all.. but then it comes to "only if the mind could control the heart"</p>
