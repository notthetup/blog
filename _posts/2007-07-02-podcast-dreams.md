][0]Knowing how much I **blabber**, it will not be a surprise to many that I am dabbling into podcasting.

I always wanted to do one, since I got hooked to podcasts last year. But, as usual, I lacked time and a group of enthusiasts to do it. (hint hint..).

Thanks to a chance Google search and my new _"Do it now" _initiative, I am **a semi-regular host** at [65bits][1]. It's a podcast by [tech65][2], about technology with a Singaporean perspective.

So... if you wanna hear **my stunning sexilicious **(as per rinaz and sweska.. see comments below) **voice** .. Ermm.. OK ner mind... forget I said that..

Whatever it is, do give it a listen and subscribe to 65bits feed or [on itunes.][3]

Here is our recent episode which is **NOT **about iPhone..
