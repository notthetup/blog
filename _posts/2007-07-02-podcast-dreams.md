Knowing how much I **blabber** , it will not be a surprise to many that I am dabbling into podcasting.

I always wanted to do one, since I got hooked to podcasts last year. But, as usual, I lacked time and a group of enthusiasts to do it. (hint hint).

Thanks to a chance Google search and my new "Do it now" initiative, I am **a semi-regular host** at [65bits][1]. It's a podcast by [Tech65][2], about technology with a Singaporean perspective.

Whatever it is, do give it a listen and subscribe to 65bits feed or [on itunes.][3]

Here is our recent episode which is **NOT** about iPhone.
