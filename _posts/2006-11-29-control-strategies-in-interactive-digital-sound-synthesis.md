**WoooHooo!! It's finally done!!**

Almost 6 months after the deadline I have managed to complete **my FYP Thesis** according to my personal standards. Well, not exactly the best peice of work I ever created, but I am finally content with what I have done.

I was never happy with what I had submitted to NUS. I knew no one was going to read it, so I didn't care. So I decided to continue work on it during my spare time. And as you know, **time** is one luxury I cannot afford.

After many weekends of procrastination and plain old laziness, I have managed to redo most of the Thesis. There are some mistakes in it for sure. I will try my best to iron them out. Right now it v1.5 and its "**Internet Worthy**". So here it is!!

_I am not sure about publication rights for this. But since the content was created by me, I think I should be able to distribute it to anyone who wishes to use it for scientific and educational use!_

Call me crazy, mad or whatever you wish, I don't care! Today, I am Happy!!
