<p>What do you get when you put the some of the best artists together.. You get something like <strong>PD7</strong>.</p>
<p>PD7 is a track in Anoushka Shankar's new album <a href="http://www.myspace.com/shankarkale"> Breathing Under Water</a> in collaboration with Karsh Kale.</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/12b4225b9da0407c544b5110.L._AA300_.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The credits for this track include some BIG names, and some awesome artists. This track features..</p>
<p><strong>Anoushka Shankar</strong> (Sitar)<br />
<strong>Karsh Kale</strong> (Percussion)<br />
<strong>Shankar Mahadevan</strong> (Vocals)<br />
<strong>Pt. Vishwa Mohan Bhatt</strong> (Mohan Veena)<br />
<strong>Midival Punditz</strong> (Atmosphere and stuff)</p>
<p>Anoushka, for the unenlightened, is the daughter of Sitar Maestro <strong><em>Ravi Shankar</em></strong>. And I will say that her Sitar sounds as sweet as her fathers. But, what I have been realising with each of her albums, is that her orchestration is also amazing.. Ofcourse, she does have some amazing artists to help her along.</p>
<p>PD7.. probably named after<em> <a href="http://www.swarganga.org/raaga_details.php?raagid=156">Puriya Dhanashree</a></em>, the <em>raag</em> which the song is in and the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tala_(music)">Rupak</a></em> <em>taal</em> which has <strong>7</strong> beats, which it is set in; has amazing vocals from Shankar Mahadevan and including Sitar-Vocal duets with Anoushka; great ambience... thanks to the Punditz; awesome percussion and <em>tabla</em> by Karsh and a lovely opening by Pt. Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. The composition in <em>Puriya Dhanashree</em> is very melodious and works well with all the base and electronica around it..</p>
<p><strong>It's a track you can't get enough of.. Just can't.. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.anoushkashankar.com/albums/breathing-under-water/">Here is a preview</a> of the track.</p>
