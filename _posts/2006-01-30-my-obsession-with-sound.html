<p>I am obsessed with <strong>sound</strong>. Its crazy, everywhere I go, I hear sound. Haha..</p>
<p>Jokes aside, sound is really an amazing thing. Everying from it creation to perception is incredible.</p>
<p>Superfacially, it is very simple and elegant. Sound is vibrations of various frequiencies. It travels as longitudinal waves and is perceived by our ear again as a mixture of frequiencies.</p>
<p>However, if you really look into sound, it's <strong>huge</strong>. Acoustics, the science of sound is an emense field of study, has applications in many other disciplines, has been studies for years and still an active research field, and <strong>NOT</strong> persued in NUS by any of the Departments. That's sad, for me as well as NUS.....</p>
<p>Anyhow (as Lulu would said...:p), I have decided to start a sound blog. I'll blog about all the cool things about sound and the related fields... Maybe I should move over to other blogging service like Wordpress and use categories... Maybe.... A lot of 'maybe's shall remain 'maybe' untill 2nd May...</p>
