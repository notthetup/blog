<p>This is inspired by a conversation between the Tech65 crew  a couple of weeks ago....</p>
<p><a TITLE="Cache" HREF="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/snapshot-2007-12-16-15-13-33.jpg"><img ALT="Cache" SRC="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/snapshot-2007-12-16-15-13-33.jpg" WIDTH="484" HEIGHT="280" /></a></p>
