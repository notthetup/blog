<p>OK. So this year AGAIN, I pulled a lame <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/this-wordpress-blog-has-been-taken-down/">April Fool's prank</a>. And I am proud to say, I fooled 1 person again.. Fortunately, not the same one as <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/04/01/fools-and-their-gold/">last year</a>... Ah hah!!...</p>
<p>Google's prank this year was kinda lame too, with their <a HREF="http://www.google.com/virgle/index.html">Virgile Mars program</a>.</p>
<p>Blizzard rocked!! With new units like <a HREF="http://www.starcraft2.com/features/terran/taurenmarine.xml">Tauren Marines</a>, <a HREF="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/bard/bardclass.xml">Bards</a> in WoW which make people play guitar hero, and  <a HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/us/diablo2exp/pinata.html">Piñata</a>'s in Diablo2.</p>
<p><a HREF="http://ping.sg">Ping.sg</a> had an amazing "prank". The "Whose ping is it" game.. Simple and yet addictive. And the pingsters made it into a competition.. Now these guys really have loads of free time. Their respective bosses should give them some extra work.. :p</p>
<p>And <a HREF="http://revision3.com/systm/">Systm</a>.. did an amazing episode with <a HREF="http://revision3.com/systm/zapper/">April fools pranks</a>. Mountain Dew as a light source!!.. Perpetual Light Machine?</p>
<p><strong>So did you get fooled today?? </strong></p>
