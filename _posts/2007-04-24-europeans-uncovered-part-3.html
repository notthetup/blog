<p><strong>The Italians.</strong></p>
<p>Italians are noisy. Being noisy is their birth right, and they sure practice it.</p>
<p>The Italians also come in many flavours.<br />
-The noisy<br />
-The really really noisy<br />
-The 'reindeer' Italians<br />
-The monkeys<br />
-The "I am so mad" Italians<br />
-The shampoo models.</p>
<p>The Italians' ability to make noise increases exponentially with the number of Itailians around, and the number of beers in each of them.</p>
<p>All Italians love Totti.. (Whoever that is.)</p>
<p>All Italians love Berlousconi.. (Whoever that is.)</p>
<p>All Italians can be classified as Facists or Communists. It's Binary, you have to be either, there is no other option.</p>
<p>Italians love to Fart.</p>
<p>All Italians can differentiate between Parmeggiano and Grana Padano.</p>
<p>The body language of Italians conveys more information than the speech. They talk rubbish mostly anyway.</p>
<p>Italians make Pizza with 100g of live yeast per KG flour.</p>
<p>Its is forbidden for Italians to have short hair.</p>
<p>Italians do it better..  (So they say.)</p>
