<p>.. the question which is on everyone's mind these days...</p>
<p>I liked <a HREF="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zdnet/Howell/~3/180933354/">Denise Howell's</a> take on it..</p>
<p><em>"Forget about things like the fact Google’s at $741 and Apple’s at $191. Were you to try to rent a car at San Jose Airport tomorrow (Wednesday), you would discover that every single vehicle — from every single carrier — is spoken for." </em></p>
