<p><strong>WoooHooo!!! It's finally done!!!!</strong></p>
<p>Almost 6 months after the deadline I have managed to complete <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>my FYP Thesis</strong></span> according to my personal standards. Well...not exactly the best peice of work I ever created, but I am finally content with what I have done.</p>
<p>I was never happy with what I had submitted to NUS. I knew no one was going to read it, so I didn't care. So I decided to continue work on it during my spare time. And as you know, <strong>time</strong> is one luxury I cannot afford.</p>
<p>After many weekends of procrastination and plain old laziness, I have managed to redo most of the Thesis. There are some mistakes in it for sure. I will try my best to iron them out. Right now it v1.5 and its "<strong>Internet Worthy</strong>". So here it is!!!</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a title="Thesis" href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/FinalThesis.pdf"><strong>Control Strategies inÂ Real-Time Interactive Digital Sound Synthesis</strong></a></span></p>
<p><em>I am not sure about publication rights for this. But since the content was created by me, I think I should be able to distribute it to anyone who wishes to use it for scientific and educational use!</em></p>
<p>Call me crazy, mad or whatever you wish, I don't care! Today...I am Happy!!!</p>
