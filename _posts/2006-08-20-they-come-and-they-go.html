<p>This is the<strong> rule of life</strong>... Every single person who comes into your life, has to get out of it. If they come in... they have to go out. It's the absolute truth. Just like <strong>math</strong> and <strong>boolean</strong> logic.</p>
<p>The only thing that can change is the amount of time a person stays in your life. One can only hope that this amount is forever. But, as is life, <em>things change</em>,<em> people change</em>.</p>
<p>It's a truely sad, when you say good-bye to people, whom you never thought would leave your life. But, that is <strong>inevitable</strong>. The only thing you can hope, is that just like before that person would walk into your life again. Or atleast another chance meeting somewhere least expected.</p>
<p>However, the finite possibility of not seeing that person again in the rest of your life is the scariest idea that comes to my mind.<em> What if...??</em></p>
<p>Well... such is life. Love it, hate it.. you have to accept it.</p>
