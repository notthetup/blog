<p>Can geeks cook?? Well they sure can, whether what they cook is edible is different question. So anyway, from the guys at <a href="http://revision3.com/">Revision3 </a>(think <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation">Diggnation</a>.. and Alex Albrecht) comes a new cooking show. Of the <strong>geeks</strong>, for the <strong>geeks</strong> and by the <strong>geeks</strong>!!</p>
<p><a href="http://revision3.com/ctrlaltchicken">Ctrl+Alt+Chicken</a></p>
<p>The pilot 'aired' today and its really hillarious. And educational, of course. They did a "<em>Chicken Cordon Bleu</em>". Some parts were really stupid, but it was mostly quite funny. Doesn't really compare to Jamie Oliver.. But hey, its always fun to see geeks trying to cook...:p</p>
<p>So check it out and try to make some "Chicken Cordon Bleu"....</p>
