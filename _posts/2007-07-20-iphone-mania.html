<p>On Tuesday, I got to play with the iPhone. Thanks to <a href="http://tomato75.blogspot.com/2007/07/iphone-gathering-geek-terminal.html">Paddy from Bak2u</a>!!</p>
<p>My  impression of the iPhone has been a rollercoaster.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial hype <a href="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/macworld/">had me completely excited</a>.</li>
<li>After some thought, I realized that it was <a href="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/iphone-the-jack-of-all-trades/">not really that great, technologically.</a></li>
<li>The pre-Release hype and the videos that Apple release got me excited again!!</li>
<li>The post release reviews of the iPhone, and especially the keypad, made me dislike it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally when I saw it on Tuesday, I was completely excited. It was smaller and thinner than I expected. And most importantly, <strong>it worked just fine! </strong> I tried surfing CNN, ping.sg and my own blog. I even left <a href="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/07/14/pizza-pizza/#comment-4725">a comment on my own blog</a>!! Hahahaah</p>
<p>All the sites looked really sweet. The text was crisp clear and navigating was a breeze. Though,  long pages tended to be annoying to scroll through. The map feature seems really promising and the keyboard did not give any problems.</p>
<p>I was not too impressed by the cover flow and the photo gallery, where you can do your mondo-cool finger acrobatics to show it off.</p>
<p>I was unable to testing calling and sms, though, I cant see how iPhone can do either of these things better or worse than any other phones out there.</p>
<p>Then my colleague asked me today, if I had converted after finally touching the iPhone. Well, NO. Finally, I still feel that, from a utilitarian perspective, I see no use for most of the things it can do. On the other hand, all these effects and cool graphics are actually killing my battery. The price is also a killer. It's just too expensive for something that really is a Jack of All the trades. Even as a "Wide Screen iPod" it has not enough memory for my purpose.</p>
<p>So all in all, iPhone,<strong> still not my type of gadget</strong>...</p>
