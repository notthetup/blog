<p>I am in Pune now, for those who don't know. It’s a nice place in Maharashtra, India, where my family comes from. And right now it’s looking pretty. Well..most of it.</p>
<p>Its monsoon season and everything is green, and pretty. The otherwise yellow and dry landscape is now full of green trees. Even the grass has a green-yellowish glow about it. Looks very surreal.</p>
<p>It rains here in light drizzles, seldom heavy showers. The sky is full of clouds, and rarely do I see the sun. But still, it’s not gloomy, but bright and cheerful.</p>
<p>The temperature is also very nice, not too warm or too cool. Just nice...</p>
<p>Ahh.. This is the season to come here! Winter is pleasant, but monsoon is surely the prettiest.. :D</p>
