<p><em>When you feel all alone</em><em><br />
</em><em> And the world has turned its back on you</em><em><br />
</em><em> Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart</em><em><br />
</em><em> I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you</em><em><br />
</em><em> Its hard to find relief and people can be so cold</em><em><br />
</em><em> When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you cant take anymore</em></p>
<p><em>Let me be the one you call</em><em><br />
</em><em> If you jump Ill break your fall</em><em><br />
</em><em> Lift you up and fly away with you into the night</em><em><br />
</em><em> If you need to fall apart</em><em><br />
</em><em> I can mend a broken heart</em><em><br />
</em><em> If you need to crash then crash and burn</em><em><br />
</em><em> You're not alone</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>When you feel all alone</em><em><br />
</em><em> And a loyal friend is hard to find</em><em><br />
</em><em> Youre caught in a one way street</em><em><br />
</em><em> With the monsters in your head</em><em><br />
</em><em> When hopes and dreams are far away and</em><em><br />
</em><em> You feel like you cant face the day </em></p>
<p><em>...</em></p>
<p><em>And there has always been heartache and pain</em><em><br />
</em><em> And when its over youll breathe again</em><em><br />
</em><em> You'll breath again</em></p>
<p><em>When you feel all alone</em><em><br />
</em><em> And the world has turned its back on you</em><em><br />
</em><em> Give me a moment please</em><em><br />
</em><em> To tame your wild wild heart</em></p>
<p>I used to be a Savage Garden fan back in the JC days.<em> </em></p>
<p>Those were the carefree days.. Never really comprehended the meaning in the lyrics, actually found them absurd, but still loved the music.</p>
<p>And how life loves to mock..</p>
<p><em>Today, these lyrics express my exact feelings, and yet my lips are sealed.</em></p>
