<p>Now for some more <em>geeky</em> stuff..</p>
<p>One of the components of my FYP was a communication mechanism between controllers, mapping engins and synthesizers for sound synthesis. Now, the main part of<a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2006/04/11/fyp-blues-and-greens/"> my FYP</a>, the mapping engin, was designed to be cross-platform, and portable. Thus, we needed a communication mechanism able to support this.</p>
<p>MIDI has been one of the most popular communication mechanism for synthesis for many years. But it has had its days. We need a more extendible mechanism, which is not as hardward layer dependent like MIDI. Enter Open Sound Control (<strong>OSC</strong>).</p>
<p>"<em>OpenSound Control (OSC) is an open, transport-independent, message-based protocol developed for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices.</em>"</p>
<p>I won't go into the details. You can get them <a HREF="http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/">here</a> and   <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSound_Control">here</a> if you are interested.</p>
<p>Anyway, so as a part of my FYP I extended the Java implementation of the OSC protocol,Â <strong><a HREF="http://www.illposed.com/software/javaosc.html">JavaOSC</a></strong>. <a HREF="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~chinpen/josc.pdf">Here</a> is a paper I co-wrote on it. We called it JOE (Java OSC Extension). Now, don't laugh. It was supposed to go with MOE (Microcontroller OSC Ethernet), but that's another story..</p>
<p>Anyway, so I am still working on <strong>JavaOSC</strong>, though not alone. I have teamed up with the <a HREF="http://www.illposed.com/aboutus/">original creator of JavaOSC</a> and <a HREF="http://www.iua.upf.es/~mkalten/">other amazing people</a> in the community, to continue this project. You can find out more about it at the <a HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaosc">sourceforge site</a>. It's free, in both ways, so feel free to use it, or even better to <strong>'abuse</strong>' it.. ;)</p>
