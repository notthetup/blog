As a part of the fringe benefits of doing my **FYP** in [I2R][0], I got to attend many interesting seminars and talks there. Just attended one on Web2.0 today. Very simple, very straight forward, and very interesting.

Reminds me of [a blog post][1] from a friend..:p

Wikipedia has a nice[long article][2] on it.

A few points I took home..

* All the Web2.0 applications are content driven. The technology allows people to share and access the content easily. It's just the means.
* Lower hardware costs are major driving forces for the Web2.0 'boom'.
* **Mashups** (linking multiple available services to create newer, more useful, services) go a long way..
* Look at alternate sources of revenue..
* Finally..All you need is a simple idea.... The technologies and support is there. If you do it right, your start-up can also be bought by Google at $2m+++ ;)

Any Ideas???
