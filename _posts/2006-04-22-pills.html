<p>Blog-hopping as always, I found a friend mention that she wished &quot;there was some kind of pill I could take to give me immunity from ever falling sick.&quot;</p>
<p>I was thinking.. what other pills would I wanna have....</p>

<p><b>1.</b>Pill to <i>fall asleep immediately</i>. For those <a href="http://nttup.blogspot.com/2006/04/post-fyp-syndrome.html">sleepless nights/days</a></p>
<p><b>2.</b>Pill to <i>not fall asleep</i>. That doesn&#39;t taste horrible like coffee.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>Pill to <i>focus</i>. Less extreme way to control my gameplay and/or internet time.</p>
<p><b>4.</b>Pill for <i>hyperactivity</i>. Alternative to an expresso shot. Usefull when I need that extra punch while coding..</p>
<p><b>5.</b>Pill for <i>motivation</i>. Tons needed before boring exams.. <b>Like now</b>!!</p>
<p><b>6.</b>Pill to be <i>creative</i>. Ah this one... I really need.</p>
<p><b>7.</b>Pills for <i>food</i>. Who am I kidding?</p>
<p><b>8.</b>Pills for <i>exercise</i>. That&#39;s my conscience speaking..</p>
<p><b>9.</b>Pill to <i>force one&#39;s behaviour and feelings on thought</i>.. <a href="http://nttup.blogspot.com/2006/03/confessions-of-soon-to-be-engineer.html">Sigh..</a></p>
<p>If only..</p>
