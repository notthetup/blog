<p>I am really excited about the<strong> X-Fi</strong>... I know compared to some really high end stuff out there, this is really nothing. But, its something really good that I can afford.. Well maybe not now.... Hopefully I can buy one from TheWeed if he wins one...:D</p>
<p>Anyway, so.. when am I ever satisfied by just looking at or merely using some really cool peice of technology?? I wanna know how it works?? Especially if you claim things as Creative has claimed... So I was looking for some nice indepth technical reviews done by people on the X-Fi. But sadly, I found only generic stuff, nothing in much detail.</p>
<p>Untill I found these...<br />
