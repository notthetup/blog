<p>OK. This is too much...</p>
<p>I suddenly have this urge to go on Exchange again. Rather to go back to Danmark and study as an exchange student in DTU. <strong>Og , selvfølgelig læse Dansk, en gang tid....</strong>All over Again!!!</p>

<p>I mean it was soooo coool. All the people I met there. All the adventures that we had. All the <a HREF="http://nttsimgs.blogspot.com/2005/09/norway_23.html">places we visited.</a> And of course all the parties that we had. I am missing it.</p>
<p>What sucks....is looking at people blogging from exchange and feeling <strong>jealous</strong>. Especially so when you have been to places that they are blogging from. Its like..."<em>I know that. I have seen that. I was standing right over there!!!!</em>"</p>
<p>Man, I am sure all those who have been on exchange will agree, hands down... the best time for your Uni-life.</p>
<p>Now my friends are asking me to visit them again!!! Oh man, I am soooo tempted to go back. How I wish I could just heck these exams and tour around Europe for a whole month, or maybe two or more...:P:P</p>
<p>My friends are asking me to make plans for next summer to Italy or Greece. <strong>I wanna go</strong>!! But I really doubt I will. Jobs and stuff would have started then. So I guess not for 3 more years then. Thats too late then.... But then where is Europe going. It will always be there as it is. So there is no hurry.</p>
<p>OK! Anyway, I will surely go one day. Like I said to so many of my friends from Denmark, "I promise to come back, some day". Hope that 'some day' does happen some day....</p>
<p>As Momo said... <strong>Till Next....</strong></p>
