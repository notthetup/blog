<p>OK. I am almost sick of people asking me this question.</p>
<p><strong>Can't a guy have a nick without having to explain its etymology??</strong></p>
<p>For all those who absolutely need to know, here it goes.</p>
<p>Long long ago, in the southern province of China....</p>
<p>( <em>Erm.. sala...  wrong story.)</em></p>
<p>Long long ago, when NTT was in secondary school, he used to be absolutely crazy about aircrafts. Especially military aircrafts. He knew all about them and could recognise most of them from any angle.</p>
<p>Thus, NTT started calling himself <em>Tupolev</em>, after the Russian aircraft manufacturer, who made aircrafts like such the TU-160.....</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu-160"><img class="alignnone" title="TU" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Tu-160_at_MAKS_2007.jpg/300px-Tu-160_at_MAKS_2007.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>NTT really liked the TUs, and the fact that not many people knew about them.</p>
<p>In JC days, when NTT had to come up with a nick name to use in those quick CS games (<em>in the computers at the back of the classrooms, during lunch breaks</em>), he obviously chose "<em><strong>Tupolev</strong></em>".</p>
<p>During Uni, when NTT organized orientation for his Juniors, there was a group of his friend who were playing pranks by writing "<em>Not The</em>" behind every thing they saw. Such as....</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/notthe.jpg"><img src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/notthe.jpg" alt="" title="notthe" width="320" height="476" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-512" /></a></p>
<p>And soon using "<em><strong>Not The</strong></em>" before your nick-name became an 'in' thing among his friends.</p>
<p>Thus, NTT was born. So here you go....<strong> NTT = Not The Tupolev</strong>....</p>
<p>Later, NTT also realised that "NTT" sounds like "entity", which has some kind of <em>zen</em> feeling to it.</p>
<p>Now NTT is just plain old lazy to find a new nick, or use his real name (<em>which is difficult to pronounce properly for most people</em>).</p>
