<p>I was watching <a href="http://commandN.tv">CommandN</a>... and they mentioned about this...</p>
<p>TTC eyes Google for planning trips.<br />
--Planning a quick trip across town using public transit could one day be a matter of simply Googling the route in Toronto!</p>
<p>Ok...so Toronto Tansport Company(I think) is thinking of setting up a system where people can google for the transport routes and let the system plan their root for them..</p>
<p>Its a cool idea, but then again its not that new!! The <strong>Copenhagen</strong> Transport system has this for like 3+ years now. And it works really well. Its called the <a href="http://www.rejseplanen.dk/">Rejseplanen </a>which mean "<em>Travel Planner</em>" and it combines all the trains(local and national), busses and metros.</p>
<p>Plus it allows you to state what time you want to reach the place and can tell you what time u should be at the bus stop near ur place!</p>
<p>And it will estimate and add changeover delays according which platform your train arrives and which platform the next train is supposed to leave!!! That is cool..</p>
<p>How I wish they had something like that for Singapore.... I'd be addicted to it forever.. I can't even remember when the<strong> A1s</strong> leave PGP and when the <strong>A2s</strong>...</p>
