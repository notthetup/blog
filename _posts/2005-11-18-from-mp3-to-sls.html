<p>Now for some <strong>techie stuff.</strong>..:P:P</p>
<p>Recently, I have been to exposed to a lot of good techie stuff. There were some really cool seminars/tutorials in I2R. And me being the me....I had to go for all, even when they were during exam period. I feel that such things should matter more than exams. But anyway...</p>
<p>So the highlight were these talks by Dr. Jürgen Herre from Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS). He has been contributing to MPEG audio standards since the time of MPEG-1. So he's like pretty big in the field.</p>
<p>The talks were so cool. He talked abt the evolution of the MPEG standards. Its really amazing to see that. I mean how much progress people have made!!! Whats even more amazing is the amount of efforts that have been put in in these things!</p>
<p>For the un-initiated, MPEG-1 or specifically MPEG-1 Layer 3 is what u know as mp3.</p>
<p>In the talk Dr. Jürgen was talking abt the latest MPEG standards. The MPEG-4. For general audio, one can acheive 'good quality'....rather acceptably good quality at as low as 24kbps!!! And he demo-ed it. And it sounded nice. A bit synth, but that's if you are very very picky about things. But come on....for 24kbps....i'd take that anyday.....</p>
<p>Today Dr. Jürgen had a 'tutorial' about Multi-Channel encoding. The stuff they do so that you can have ur precious 5.1 audio over channels ment for stereo or mono.....Another amazing field. Man I wish I could understand 1/2 the stuff that they were talking about. I mean I kinda got it but not fully. There is so much that people have done. MPEG-Surround the new standards that is gives 'good quality' 5.1 in as low as 42kbps!!! Just amazing...</p>
<p><strong>Parametric Coding is the way to go!!!!.</strong>...(Ner mind if you dont get it. Else ask me....if you dare...)</p>
<p>I am so gratefull to I2R allowing me to do my FYP there. I get a chance to meet and rub shoulder(in a figurative way) with all these great ppl....I hope I2R has more such <em>cool talks</em>...</p>
<p>Anyway, so much for MPEG and mp3s. I still prefer my <strong>ATRAC</strong>...so back to my <em>Mini-Disk</em>....:P:P</p>
