<p>So I went the latest <strong>Creative Warehouse Sale </strong>last Friday. And I was so excited!! All the cool technology for me to touch and feel and listen to! Lemme do a summary of the stuff I saw there...</p>
<p><strong>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_X-Fi">The X-Fi.</a></strong> Creative's new flagship Sound Blaster. Really cool sound card for the semi-audiophiles out there. Has a really nice upconverting feature. <em>Upconverts</em> from 16bit to 24bit as well as from 2.0 to 5.1! I really wanna know how they do it. I do know though that they need a really poweful DSP (which they sport, something with 10,000 MIPS!!) for all the stuff they are doing..</p>
<p><strong>-<a href="http://sg.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=437&amp;subcategory=438&amp;product=11430">The HQ-2300D</a>.</strong> Really cool headphones. They have their own DAC and Amps..in a small little box.. That means nicer coupling and better sound! No more "<em>damn it i bought these cool guy headphones but there is impedence mismatch with my driver...:'(</em>" Also they support Dolby Digital or DTS inputs, by having its own decoder (inside that box)! This guy can optimise your 5.1 DTS or Dolby Digital for a headphone. Kinda like the Holophonic sound thingy. The best part is that if you dont't have 5.1 source, it can upconvert the 2.0 to 5.1 for you, just like the X-Fi!!</p>
<p>-<a href="http://sg.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&amp;subcategory=214&amp;product=14331"><strong>The Zen Vision M.</strong> </a>Saw the so called iPod killer. Have the agree that the UI is <strong>not</strong> as intutive as the iPod. Took me and TheWeed like 5mins to figure out how to use the scroll pad thingy. Oh and its huge! But still if I ever buy one, might go with Creative. It's the accessories and extra functions. Oh and also the codec support.</p>
<p><strong>-The Decoders and Mixers.</strong> More like connectivity options for the various Creative devices that people own. Nice ideas, especially the fact that they have so many options.</p>
<p><strong>-The Creative In-ear headphones.</strong> Keng bought one of those, says they are really as efficient as they promise to be! Have been thinking about those since I heard Robert Heron from Dl.Tv ranting about it!</p>
<p><strong>-The Creative Prodikeys and family.</strong> Cool stuff, one day when I know more about music I'll think about these..</p>
<p><strong>-The S$39 1st Gen mp3 players.</strong> Would be fun just to open it up and see whats what!</p>
<p><strong>-The Creative Webcams.</strong> Going at <em>insane prices</em>!</p>
<p>So what did I buy?? <strong>Nothing</strong>..:( What do I want?? The X-Fi, the HQ-2300D and most importantly a <strong>Job</strong>!!! Would be so cool to work with Creative!! :D</p>
