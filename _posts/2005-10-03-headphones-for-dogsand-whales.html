<p>Alright...</p>
<p>So I am looking for a <strong>nice pair of headphones</strong>. Not too expensive, but something that gives a nice flat frequency response and undistorted sound at considerably high levels.</p>
<p>With some help I managed to shortlist the Sennheiser HD497.</p>
<p>I was looking for it at a Best Denki store when I chanced upon another headphone from another brand (I seem to forgotten the brand and the model). The technical specs read,"</p>
<p><strong>"Frequency response 20-30000 Hz"</strong></p>
<p><strong>What??? 30000Hz???<br />
</strong><br />
Werent we taught in like secondary that a human ear can only hear between 20-20kHz??My <a href="http://www.act.elektro.dtu.dk/Education/Courses?view=2&amp;lang=en-gb&amp;code=31200">course in Acoustic </a>(at <a href="http://www.dtu.dk">DTU</a>) also taught me that human hearing was even worst than what was taught in secondary school. To actually hear a sound at 20kHz, you need to a sound that is <strong>as loud as a jet engin!!!!</strong></p>
<p><em>So what do we do with a headphone that can give out a 30000kHz frequency??<br />
</em><br />
What's funier is that most of <strong>Sony's headphones</strong> sport a frequency response of more than 22kHz! And the more $$ you pay for the pair the more in-audible frequencies your headphones can output!!!</p>
<p>This is exemplified in the <strong>Sony MDR-SA5000</strong>. Costs<strong> US$ 699.99!!!</strong> Boasts a frequency response of<strong> 5-110,000Hz!!!!</strong> And there is no typo here, its "<strong>a hundred and ten kilo Hertz</strong>"!!!!!!!</p>
<p>The only reason I can think of is that with such headphones, you can not only listen yourself, but let your dog listen as well!!!!</p>
<p>So next time <strong>your dog (or your whale) seems bored, go get it a pair of Sony/Sennheiser headphones</strong>. And both of you can enjoy the music!</p>
