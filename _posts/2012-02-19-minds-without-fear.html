<blockquote>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br />
Where knowledge is free<br />
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br />
By narrow domestic walls<br />
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br />
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br />
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br />
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br />
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br />
Into ever-widening thought and action<br />
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake</p>
<p>-Rabindranath Tagore</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Nearly every inch of us on the line<br />
Plucking on the string of everything that could have been<br />
Search and rescue treasured fractals of our lives</p>
<p>Tham ja murh ja naseeba<br />
(Stop and turn oh fate)<br />
Kahaan le aaye naseeba<br />
(Where did you bring me oh fate?)</p>
<p>If you move like lightning<br />
Charging through the angry skies<br />
And intercept on the arrow of time</p>
<p>But we just might make this up<br />
With our heads held high<br />
So this story continues with<br />
Minds without fear</p>
<p>Baadal lehraaye maat ka jo<br />
(When the clouds of defeat hover over you)<br />
Ban jaa bijli, baadal ko cheer tu<br />
(Transform into lightning, tear apart the clouds)<br />
Rooh ko kar de yun roshan<br />
(Enlightens your spirit)<br />
Bas mushqil hai, naamumkin toh nahi<br />
(Itâ€™s difficult, but not impossible)<br />
Ban jaa bijli naseeba<br />
(Transform into lightning, oh fate!)</p>
<p>Tune in to the brightness within us<br />
Become reveal and expand<br />
Whiz past the visible universe<br />
Come on!</p>
<p>-Imogen Heap and Vishal/Shekhar</p></blockquote>
