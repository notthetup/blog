<p>I have been suffering from what I term as the <strong>Post FYP Syndrome</strong> (PFS).</p>
<p>It has two main aspects to it, the <strong>psychological</strong> aspect, and the <strong>physiological</strong> aspect.</p>
<p>First the physiological aspect, lack of sleep:  After conditioning my body to be dependent on caffeine for almost 2-3 months, the sudden withdrawal (which was done with a lot of determination) is causing havoc. Cravings are a huge problem... and I tend to stay away from vending machines, coffee dispensers and Spinelli's....</p>
<p>My sleeping pattern (actually the lack of one) is the other thingy. Too used to the 3-4hrs per night, and so now I canâ€™t sleep for more than 3-4hrs, even when I try very hard. And I still woke like super tired today.</p>
<p>The physiological effects are worst. Now that most of the urgent deadlines have been met and all, I have time to rest, do nothing, slack... But, I can't get myself to slack.. Its too depressing... :'( Cos then I end up thinking about <strong>life</strong> and stuff... :"(...</p>
<p>So I have to work... But I cant get myself to work.. Cos I am so tired of working...Just finished FYP lah... need to recoup.... but I can't... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
