<p>Day before yesterday, I attended the <a HREF="http://www.play-symphony.com/">Play! A Video Game Symphony</a> concert.</p>
<p>When I first heard about this, I was surprised. I couldn't link VideoGame music to symphony. Just didn't fit. But the more I thought about it, I realised that music was an integral part of most great games. And there are so many really amazing peices of music in games, for eg. Zelda, Final Fantasy Series, Warcraft 3, Age of Empires, Civilizations...</p>
<p>Not only PC games, console games as well and even old school stuff. Who can forget the <a HREF="http://emuse.ebaumsworld.com/flash/play/1825/">SuperMarioBros tune</a>? It's classic, and I can never get bored of it. It is amazing what people composed with the technological limitations of old hand held game consoles. It's also really great to see people still listening and 'using' that music in these days... For example the <a HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-hh1dkFNsI">Nintendo Acapella</a>, is such a classic...</p>
<p>Anyway, so the concert was <strong>not</strong> that amazing. The orchestra seemed pretty <em>noob</em>. And the videos being showed on the screen were even more <em>noob</em>. They should show like <a HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXIZEMpmZY">Mario SpeedRuns</a> and stuff, not some noob jumping right in front of the Goombas. They also kept showing facial close ups of the orchestra members. That was really funny.. :p</p>
<p>But, it was great going back to the world of VideoGames after many days.. Recently, the only game I have ever played is UT2K4 to relieve some stress.. :p</p>
