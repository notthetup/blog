Update:

Like I said, all are **welcome** to attend the presentation. ECE has confirmed that the lab will be open that day from **9am** onwards, and there will be few more presentations before mine. You can catch them also.

As for my presentation, I have a little advice, come with an open mind, have lots of imagination, and most importantly, **ask questions**!
