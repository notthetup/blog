<p>I noticed during my conversation with pingsters during the ping.sg meetup #3, that I 'name dropped' quite a few famous people on the internet, like <a HREF="http://twit.tv">Leo Laporte</a>, <a HREF="http://blog.digg.com/">Kevin Rose</a>... (Yes, yes I was trying to act geeky.... )</p>
<p>Forbes magazine ran an article where they named the <a HREF="http://www.forbes.com/2007/01/23/web-celeb-25-tech-media_cx_de_06webceleb_0123top_slides_2.html">top 25 "Web Celebs".</a> They voted <a HREF="http://www.youtube.com/user/lonelygirl15">Lonelygirl15</a> (Youtube fame) as the top Web Celeb.</p>
<p>My colleague was telling me that he was watching some TV show on one of the educational channels where they counted down the most famous internet personalities. I believe The Ninja from <a HREF="http://www.askaninja.com/">Ask-A-Ninja</a> was one of the top few.</p>
<p>Isn't it interesting that these people, who are just tech enthusiasts doing the stuff they like, are becoming celebrities overnight. And I am very sure that their celebrity status is no lesser than that of Hollywood stars. OK. Agreed that they might not have as much following, but still they have fans, crazy ones.</p>
<p>What's really great is that Internet being still a young and small arena, many of these people are surprisingly accessible. I emailed <a HREF="http://darrenkitchen.vox.com/">Darren Kitchen</a> from <a HREF="http://hak5.org">HAK5</a> last week about the headphone he was using, and he replied the next day. To him, it was just another dude/fan asking him a simple question, but for me it was the guy who I see on TV every month, and he just replied to my email! Maybe it's me, but I feel that it's a big thing.</p>
<p>With the internet, for people who do TV, or Musicians and artists, their audience has become suddenly more accessible. Not everyone of them takes advantage of this channel, but I have been surprised, when the <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/04/28/136/#comments">some of my favorite artists</a> commented on my blog. I guess it was just an "vanity search" for them, but I was super excited. For me, these people are my Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts.</p>
<p>So what will you do if you see <a HREF="http://dl.tv/">Partick Norton</a> riding down the escalator at the mall, or <a HREF="http://commandn.tv">Amber MacArthur</a> in the next car?</p>
