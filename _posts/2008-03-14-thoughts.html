<p>As I sit here in the Esplanade library listening to La Valse D'Amelie by Yann Tiersen, I wonder...</p>
<p>Where are things going wrong? Why am I unable to do all the things I want to do? What is it that I lack? The motivation? The desire? The drive?</p>
<p>But I do have loads of motivation.. don't I? What happened to all the enthusiasm that a conversation, or a sight would give? Or does it not work anymore? Am I getting too used to it? So then why? How much of my feeling are based on the inspritation I get form her? And what happens if this ceases to exists? Will I feel the same?</p>
<p>I really need to get my life back in shape. I can foresee more challenges.. and to overcome these I will need all the strengths I can muster. Physical, mental and emotional...</p>
<p>Many things are slipping out of hand.. I need to evaluate my life and decide on my priorities.. And accordingly decide what I should let go, and what I should continue doing..</p>
