<p>I love rain.. I really do. Especially in India.. Maybe its an India thing, but people here love rain, love to get drenched and love to play in the rain. I remember when I was very young my parent would take me to play in the rain, every year, during the monsoon at Marine Drive!</p>
<p>It's kinda expected in the place which becomes dry and almost scary in the summer which preceeds the monsoon.</p>
<p>But this is just too much rain. It has been raining for the last 3-4 days continuously. Not once have the roads dried up..  And my backyard garden is flooded, I mean really flooded... Hopefully the roads are free and all the events take place without any problems...</p>
<p>I hear Mumbai is worst, I hope my cousin does not get stuck! The good thing is that I don't have to and won't go to Mumbai this time... :)</p>
