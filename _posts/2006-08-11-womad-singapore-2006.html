<p>Just 2 weeks left before WOMAD starts...</p>
<p>The list of artists and the timings of all the performances is also out. Check out the WOMAD Singapore Website.</p>
<p>The wesbite is in flash and slow. So to help those with slower internet connections, I have made a pdf of all the performance timings. You can download it <a href="http://www.theupload.com/view.php?id=00048570">here</a>. <i>(Sorry I don't any have webspace currently, so I have to use stuff like this.. :( )</i></p>
<p>Ofcourse you will <strong>have</strong> to go back to the <a href="http://womad.org/">website</a> for other stuff like details about the artists and other information.</p>
<p>I should be going on 2 of the 3 days. I have not decided on which two yet though. Friday looks good as they have the Musafir Gypsies of Rajasthan; Saturday starts with Stevie Goldsmith's performance; Sunday is the Finale. :S</p>
<p>Who else is going for WOMAD?? Leave a comment..:p</p>
