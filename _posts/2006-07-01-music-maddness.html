<p>This is crazy.. It's pretty cheap to buy stuff like CDs, Books and all here in India. I am sure many of you would agree.. So I went to this big music shop today and went absolutely crazy there..</p>
<p>I got like 15+ CDs.. and it cost me like 1/3rd what I'd pay in Singapore...</p>
<p>So many CDs I wanted to buy, but couldn't find in Singapore, including <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2006/06/21/adicted-again-2/">Piya Bavari</a>, MidiVal Times, Bend it Like Beckham OST, a bunch of classical stuff.. and a lot more.. The shop seemed to be quite well stocked.. esp with different types of music.</p>
<p>The best part is that at the end they gave a privilege card so that I get like 10% discount :). I am going back there next time I am here... :D</p>
<p>Now...I can't wait to go back home and check out all the stuff I got!</p>
