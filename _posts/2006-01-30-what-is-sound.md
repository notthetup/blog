What is sound??

To a musician, its the note that is being played. To the acoustician its the pressure of air at the specific instance. To the engineer, its just a logical high or low value of a bit. To the physicist it is just a logitudinal wave. And to the normal human, it is the stimulus to one of the 5 senses we have.

It is simple and yet amazing.
