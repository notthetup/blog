<p><strong>I</strong> never understand some people. And NO, I am not talking about politicians or that new lecturer in your lvl 3000 class .</p>
<p>I am talking about people who do moronic things and instead of just stopping there...do they advertise their moronic actions..... Let me exemplify what I mean.</p>
<p>I saw this a couple of days ago on the door of my dorm's (PGP) common "Reading Room".</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-395" title="img_1746" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_1746.jpg?w=225" alt="img_1746" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>I mean <strong>how stupid can anyone get???</strong> And even if you do something stupid, you dont have to tell the whole world about it....</p>
<p>From the dawn of time there have been notices warning residents not to leave their belongings and especially<strong> books</strong> in the reading rooms. But, every semester, especially nearer to the exams <em>ALL the tables in ALL the Reading Rooms</em> in my dorm are<strong> 'reserved'</strong> by people leaving their books on them.</p>
<p>Not that I ever study in these Reading Rooms, but I find this action very annoying. Its not fair for anyone who does not find an empty table on the 1st day. He'd probably not find one ever again.</p>
<p>Once.....me and my friend were contemplating on <strong>switching the books on different tables </strong>just to irritate those who had 'reserved' the tables... The Reading Room was totally empty with around 30 books on the 10+ tables. Would have been a nice mix and match game huh???</p>
<p>What's funny is <em>that small scribble,</em> at the bottom right corner, on the paper.</p>
<p>"I promise not to pursue this issue any further upon return"</p>
<p><strong>So do I...my dear friend....so do I....</strong></p>
<p>Speaking about <strong>reservations</strong>...did you notice how people 'reserve' seats in canteens. And I emphasise, HOW?? I don't want to talk abt whether one should reserve seats at all. Thats a touchy topic.</p>
<p>But, I have noticed people 'reserving' seats in canteens with <strong>tissue paper packet</strong>. That is ridiculous. If that's not bad enuff, I have seen a table in the Arts Canteen reserved by a<strong> wallet and a mobile phone!!!!</strong>(I am not lying...I have a witness. )</p>
<p>And I am just lost for words.....</p>
