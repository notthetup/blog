<p>I am really saddened by the recent <strong>earthquake</strong> in Northern India and Pakistan. It's really a tragic thing.</p>
<p>Though such events can't be prevented, I feel sad for the people from that region. And even prediction of such, cannot help much since the power of Nature is overwhelming.</p>
<p>What is even saddening is that the region of Kashmir has never seen peace for eons now. I mean I have always heard of the beauty of the Kashmir valley, but it seems that that, is now a thing of the distant memories.</p>
<p>Just when things seem to get a little better for the people, nature decided to unleash its wrath on them. All I can say is<strong>.... <em>Nasheeb....</em></strong></p>
<p>We can learn one thing from this though....Nature does not know borders. It's a human concept. A concept created by those who wanted power and control over others. A natural tragedy like this though can strike over borders, not differentiating between any state, any province, any country, just dealing equal damage to all.</p>
<p>It seems that this event may bring the neighbours closer. Its a pity that such tragic happenings are required to generate friendships between two neighbours. Ah well, beggars cant be choosers.</p>
<p>I hope one day, I will get to see the beautiful Kashmir valley again.....</p>
