<p>I know I am just making <em>excuses</em>. But, because mom's not around, and <a HREF="http://members.lycos.co.uk/thew33d/wp/">TheWeed</a> is leaving, past 2 weeks have been super sinful. Here is the list of all my indulgences during  this week and the last, including some from the near-future....</p>
<p>1. <strong>Carl's Jr.</strong> (And our good friend Carl)<br />
2. <strong>Subway</strong> (Good, cheap, healthy and in NUS!!!)<br />
3. <strong>Pasta Mania</strong> (Anything for a Spinach Tortellini)<br />
4. <strong>Starbucks</strong> (Java Chip Frap != Rhumba Frap)<br />
5. <strong>Mos Burger</strong> (Rice is good...)<br />
6. <strong>The </strong><strong>Brownie Factory</strong> (Almost the ultimate sin)<br />
7. <strong>Kebabs at Moto</strong> (Why not??)<br />
8.<strong> Canadian Pizza</strong> (Cheap and good)<br />
9. <strong>Home-made Tiramisu</strong> (Another adventure ??)<br />
10. <strong>Fullerton Chocolate Buffet</strong> (The ultimate sin? or an ultimate farewell??)</p>
<p>The last three are to be. Lets hope they go as well as the 1st 7.</p>
