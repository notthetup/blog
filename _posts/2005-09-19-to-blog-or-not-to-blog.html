<p>I have been contemplating about blogging for a few months. Its kinda fun, but it needs discipline. The thing that I lack the most. I mean I even had a 'cool' website once,back in secondary school days. Don't know what happened to it. Cant even seem to find it. All I remember was that it was hosted on Geocities, and the address has a "/CapeCanaveral/" inside!!!</p>
<p>So I decide to give it a try. I guess I have to start learning discipline somewhere. Furthermore, its a nice way to stay in touch with friends, and I get to practice my writing. Oh and my HTML as well. Have forgotten that as well. Man! this University, makes you forget everything.....</p>
<p>Anyway, so here is a try at the most hyped thing in town. Hope it works.</p>
