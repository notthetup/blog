<p>Now don't pull an "Ajit-jijaji" and ask me '<em>Hi Shama kon??</em>'</p>
<p>Anyway, not many people know but I am <strong>taking part in a <em>Natak</em> (Drama</strong>). For those about to faint, read this through first.</p>
<p>So every year Maharashtra Mandal Singapore (read: cultural association of all Marathi people in Singapore), organises a Marathi <em>Natak</em>. Since my parentsÂ have had great links with Maharashtra Mandal, I have been involved in the <em>Natak</em> for many years.</p>
<p>For those who know me better, you'd know that I won't be acting in the <em>Natak</em>. Hehe. Not my kind of work. Though I have done it before. Twice. Once as a salesboy and once as a servent-boy. Both when I was much younger.. (ya Duh!!)</p>
<p>Anyway, since I was never good at the artsy side of Dramas, I have always been asked to do the more techy stuff. And for the last 2-3 <em>Nataks</em>, I have been <strong>the sound guy</strong>! Hehe what else?</p>
<p>So I coordinate the various music peices  and sound effects needed in the natak as well as sit at the console and mix the various sources during the <em>Natak</em>. Have to agree it's really fun to play with the mixers. They have always fascinated  me.</p>
<p>But anyway, I have been going to these <em>Natak</em>-practices every weekend and a few weekdays since I came back. I have had to travel all over Singapore, with my own set of speakers (quite crappy ones) and CD/MD players for the practices. It's fun but really tiring, especially on the weekends..</p>
<p>Only one more week and it will all be over. The <em>Natak</em> is on <strong>Sunday 31st</strong> at <strong>Grassroots Club Auditorium</strong>, somewhere at AMK-YCK there, at<strong> 1800hrs</strong>. Though I doubt anybody reading this might be interested in attending, if you are interested, please contact me somehow. Or at least leave a comment..</p>
