<p><a HREF="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/122390.asp">This</a> is cool! Finally they are going to try to <a HREF="http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/category_sub.asp?cid=246">reduce</a> the amount of plastic bags that we use. A lot of trash can be saved if people are forced to reuse platic bags at the <strong>supermarket</strong>. One more step to lesser trash! Yay.</p>

<p>It's wierd, I was never a tree hugger for most of my life. Not that I did not care, but I always felt that it was too great a goal to acheive for societies in this world. However, my 6 month in <a HREF="http://www.ehponline.org/members/2004/112-8/windmills.jpg">Denmark </a>changed my view. There was a pro-environment spririt in almost every European, (surely every Dane), that I met. Everybody cared for the environment, and encouraged others to care as well. I was reminded many times to recycle platic instead of just dunking it into the trash. The interesting thing is that most of the people I knew there was quite young. Environmental concerns are generally associated with older people, so this was even more surprising..</p>
<p>Their motivation and interest and the lack of pollution in Denmark, gave me hope. I believe we need that type of concern and enthusiasm to be able to have a environmentally friendly society. well, at least its starting. I plan to bring my own bags to the supermarket from now on! <strong>Wanna join??</strong></p>
