<p>Either I am really bored, or I am gone totally crazy. Or Both..</p>
<p>Anyway, so in the past few weeks lots of cool things happened in tech world. And what have I been doing them?? Following such things instead of studying....ahhhhhhhh</p>
<p>There was CES06... There was MacWorld and other stuff that I just found out about...</p>
<p>CES06 for those who are trying the various combinations is <a href="http://www.cesweb.org">Consumer Electronic Show 2006</a>. It took place in the 1st week of Jan.  It was in Vegas.. Only if I had been in Vegas then.... Sigh.. Just 2 weeks off..</p>
<p>Anyway, so I have been watching PodCasts of Dl.Tv's CES coverage (I am not so free...but....) Man its sooo cool. I mean all those gadgets and technology... I want!! Well at least to touch...and play with for a while...</p>
<p>And then there was <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/">MacWorld</a>. Who can forgot our friend from the other side of Computing world and their new friend, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/media/2006/01/MACINTEL1.jpg">The Intel Guy in a Bunny Suit</a>.....</p>
<p>The best part of MacWorld was the new<a href="http://engadget.com/2006/01/10/apple-leaps-ahead-with-dual-core-intel-macbook-pro/"> Apple MacBook Pros</a>... Hehe..</p>
<p>"Intel Core Duo processor at either 1.67 or 1.83GHz, 512MB - 2GB RAM, built-in iSight, FrontRow, FireWire 400, two USB 2.0 ports, ExpressCard/34, MagSafe power, 802.11g (AirPort Extreme), Bluetooth 2.0 EDR), gigabit Ethernet, backlit keyboard, Apple remote input, 15.4-inch 1440 x 900 display, ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 with either 128 or 256MB of RAM and dual-link DVI (for 30-inchers), an 80GB or 100GB drive, and dual-layer DVD burner"</p>
<p>And being an x86 processor...you could, people speculate, run your good old Windows on it!!! That would be nice would'nt it??</p>
<p>But, don't hold your breadth and hold on to your WinXP cds... Due to some firmware compatibility issues, XP wont be able to work with it..... Damn it...<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/01/11/no-xp-on-intel-macs-but-vista-is-good-to-go/"> Wait for Vista</a> they say...</p>
<p>Wait for Vista...Haha.. Vista sounds like Vishta... Windows Vishta.... how appropriate.. (Sorry Marathi only Joke...:P)</p>
<p>Maybe I will.. Then I can have a<strong> triple boot machine</strong>!! Use the best of each OS...</p>
<p>I cant wait for that...</p>
<p>So much for updates from the techworld... So <a href="http://hak5.org/">Trust your Technolust</a>!!</p>
