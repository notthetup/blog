<p>Not that it's new, but <a href="http://calendar.google.com/"><strong>Google Calendar Beta</strong> </a>is out. Check it out. Really cool.. Some nice features including the ability to share with people; Creating calendars and saving them as files; multiple viewing styles...</p>
<p>The only qualm I have is that it does not work well with <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>... I hope that changes soon.</p>
<p>What I just found out is that there is a way to sync my favourite desktop calendar, <a href="http://www.ipi.fi/~rainy/index.php?pn=projects&amp;project=rainlendar"><strong>Rainlender</strong></a>, with Google Calendar. Using the iCal interface avaliable on both I can move events around.</p>
<p>Still a bit buggy, but I am sure Rainy will add Google Calender support soon. Or maybe I should try to hack a calendar application myself..or <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/calendar.html">extend Rainlender</a>...:D</p>
<p>All in due time...</p>
