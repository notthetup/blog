<p><a HREF="http://nttup.blogspot.com/2005/11/tis-done.html">'Tis done.. </a></p>
<p>Just finished the graded part of my FYP today. What a ride!! Its rightfully 12MCs... Trust me!</p>
<p>First, let me thank <strong>sweska</strong>, <strong>jazz</strong> and TheWeed for actually coming down to my presentation. Especially <strong>TheWeed</strong>, I know u were really sleep deprived.. <strong>appreciated </strong>man!</p>
<p>For those who missed it.....an image of my GUI!!</p>
<p ALIGN="center">
<p>I was thinking of bloging abt FYP before... and not in a positive way.. But I realised that I got to learn a lot... And not only about academic matters but life in general...</p>
<p><strong>Positive thinking.</strong><br />
Was complaining about the 30mins limit on my presentation when my supervisor snapped back, "<em>I have an hour to explain 6 years of <strong>PhD</strong> level research</em>". Things can always be worst off... Just be happy with what you have..</p>
<p><strong>Sacrifices.</strong><br />
Haven't had a game on my laptop since start of last sem... Life is all about sacrifice, just be sure of what you want to keep and what you want to sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>Perseverance.<br />
</strong>If not for this...I would have never been able to clean the 100++ bugs I found in my code... Last one found and cleaned 10hrs before presentation..</p>
<p><strong>Passion.<br />
</strong>Passion will take you through everything, good, bad and ugly. You just need to find your passion. Its not easy, I am <strong>not</strong> sure I have found mine...but try..</p>
<p><strong>Time management.</strong><br />
OK. This one I learnt the hard way. Supervisor had once said, "<em>Don't leave everything for the last month ah</em>". I was like, <em>"Of course I won't!</em>". Who was I kidding??</p>
<p>Anyway, FYP is not done yet, still have <em>another draft</em> to do, and a <strong>HUGE</strong> amount of code to clean-up, debug and document... Sigh.. back to work...</p>
