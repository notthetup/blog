<p>Some interesting discussions about religion have been going on recently. Got to know from a <a HREF="http://uzyn.com">friends blog</a> about the fury of discussions at the Dilbert Blog. Interesting points raised by Scott Adams. It's long but worth the read.</p>

<p>And, there isÂ very little flaming, which is a welcome change from most of the online dicussions about religion.</p>
<p>I like such discussions. Helps me think and question my own religious beliefs. For those who don't know, I follow a very obscure version of Hindusim,<strong> which I have made up for myself.</strong> Most other Hindus probably find it hard to accept. Anyway, back to discussions on religions..</p>
<p>Another site that I discovered in JC days was <a HREF="http://www.religioustolerence.org">ReligiousTolerence.org</a> . Nice neutral perspective on most religions. Or so I feel. Read their hate mails. They are hillarious.</p>
<p>This guy has another<a HREF="http://www.valleyskeptic.com/george.htm"> hillarious take on religion</a> as well.</p>
