<p>Concerts, concerts, concerts!</p>
<p>So it's the 1st quarter agian, and time to <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2006/01/23/temptations/">go concert crazy again like last year</a>..</p>
<p>I must say that<a HREF="http://www.nus.edu.sg/cfa/artsfest/facts.html"> NUS Arts Festival</a> is really great.  I think there are a lot of new and interesting artsist to be heard here. And furthermore, it's cheap, hence my excitement.</p>
<p>Personally,  the concert mania start on this Sunday. Here is the line up.</p>
<p>Sunday 11th Feb - <strong>Private Concert </strong>featuring my mom!! (Indian Semi/Classical)</p>
<p>Monday 12th Feb -<strong> Sur-Laya Samvaad - A Musical Conversation</strong> by Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma &amp; Ustad Zakir Hussain (Indian Classical)</p>
<p>Friday 2nd Mar - <strong>SpectralSpace</strong> by Kim Cascone (New Media)</p>
<p>Friday 2nd Mar - <strong>Bushmen Live!</strong> by Bushmen (Reggae)</p>
<p>Sunday 4th Mar -  <strong>Broken River and Beyond</strong> by Tim O'Dwyer Trio (Jazz)</p>
<p>Sunday 11th Mar - <strong>Digital Sankirna</strong> by Ajay Kapur  (Fusion?)</p>
<p>Monday 12th Mar - <strong>Stellar Regions:</strong> Tribute to John Coltrane by Tim O'Dwyer Trio  (Jazz)</p>
<p>Friday 16th Mar -  <strong>Harp On </strong>with Katryna Tan (Classical)</p>
<p>Friday 16th Mar -  <strong>The Mathematics in Music:</strong> A Performance, Computer Demonstration and Conversation with Elaine Chew (Classical + New Media)</p>
<p>Friday 16th Mar - <strong>Press Play 2007</strong> by NUS Electronic Music Lab (Electronica)</p>
<p>Friday 23rd Mar -<strong> Hear the Art… watch the music…</strong> An Interactive Visual Art Concert (New Media)</p>
<p>And there are so many more. I also wanna go for<a HREF="http://www.nus.edu.sg/cfa/artsfest/smoke.html"> some of the workshops</a> which are part of the NUS  Arts Festival, and possibly more concerts. But it will all depend on how time permits. I am surely going for the 1st one and I already  have the  tickets for the 2nd one.</p>
<p>Any other recomendations?</p>
