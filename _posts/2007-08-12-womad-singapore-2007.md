It's [THAT][0] time of the year again, and I am excited!!

So Womad 2007 is happening on the 24-26th August at Fort Canning Park.

The line-up this year is not  as great as last year's. Except for the Asian Dub Foundation, I have not heard of any of these Artiste.

But, I have always been proved wrong , and the least known Artiste have performed the most amazing acts at Womad in the previous years, and hence, I shall not  comment anymore on the line up.

Here is a short list of who's gonna perform.

* _Asian Dub Foundation_
* _Bobby Friction and Nihal_
* Clube De Balanco
* Daara J
* David D'Or
* _Ensemble Shanbehzadeh_
* Etran Finatawa
* _Jonny Kalsi_
* Mahotella Queens
* Muntu Valdo
* Oki Dub Ainu Band
* _R-H_
* Sheila Chandra
* Shooglenifty
* _Youssou N'Dour and the Super Etoile de Dakar_

Once again, to help people with slower connections or without flash support, I have created a [pdf document][1] of the line up and schedule. You can print it out and bring it to Womad as well.

However, you will have to go back to the [website][2] for other stuff like details about the artists and other information.

The prices have gone up this year. It's S$58 at the gate, but if you are a student, you can get student's discount at $35. I still feel it's totally worth it for the amount and quality of entertainment one can get at Womad.

As I wrote in [my review last year][3], the Atmosphere, Music and Spirit come togather to create a hell of an event.

So who else is going???
