Working in the technology industry has its fair share of benefits and burdens. And then, there are times when you just don't know what to say.

This happened a couple of weeks back, while me and a couple of colleagues were working overtime trying to finish off an assignment.

_Colleague 1: I hate this f\*\*\*ing assignment, I hate this f\*\*\*ing job.  I just want to **go home**._
