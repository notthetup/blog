<p>So I'm back in Singapore. And when I found out that there was Creative Commons Day in Singapore, I was stoked. I have always believed in Open Source / Creative Commons and other forms of community based IP licensing concepts. While I believe private licensing still has some use in this world, and innovative business models around both shares and private licensing schemes are the way forward, I am pretty sure that there's tonnes of content in the world, which can easily be given a shared license without ANY loss of value to the original owner. Take for example all the private concerts that Indian Classical Musicians do. Their compositions are original (mostly improvised on the spot) and hence attract Copyright. If such content is recorded and shared under Creative Commons, the community around this music would benefit so much from it. But I digress.. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblinglibrarian/2871752489/" title="Creative Commons Singapore by ramblinglibrarian, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3240/2871752489_1b844b3018.jpg" alt="Creative Commons Singapore" width="500" height="205" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommonssingapore.wordpress.com/">Creative Commons (CC) Singapore</a> is an informal, 100% volunteer-driven, community effort. We hope to increase the awareness of Creative Commons in Singapore, so that people can make their informed choices for their creative pursuits.<a href="http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/">Ivan Chew</a> a friend from the <a href="http://garagebandmeetupsingapore.wordpress.com/">Singapore Garageband Meetup</a> (and other places) is helping out with the community aspect of CC Singapore. He was responsible for organizing the really great CC Singapore Day on 11th Nov 2011 (yes, I am slow posting this..). I was excited to meet other creatives in Singapore who also believed in Sharing.. Also thanks to Ivan, I got to record some of the session and some interviews with the attendees at CC Singapore Day.</p>
