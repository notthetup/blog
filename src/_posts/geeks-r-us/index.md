I found this list of [Geek Quotes](http://www.boardofwisdom.com/default.asp?topic=1005&start=1&search=&listowner=Public&listname=Geek).

Though I'd rate my own. Though, I dont think I am qualified to be a Geek.

Anyway here goes.

10. I'm not anti-social; I'm just not user friendly.

9. My pokemon bring all the nerds to the yard, and they're like you wanna trade cards? Darn right, I wanna trade cards, I'll trade this but not my Charizard.

8. A thousand words are worth a picture, and they load a heck of a lot faster.

7. Absolute addressing corrupts absolutely!

6. I spent a minute looking at my own code by accident. I was thinking "What the hell is this guy doing?"

5. People say that if you play Microsoft CD's backwards, you hear satanic things, but that's nothing, because if you play them forwards, they **install Windows!**

4. I would love to change the world, but they won't give me the **source code.**

3. You know it's **love** when you **memorize her IP address** to skip DNS overhead.
