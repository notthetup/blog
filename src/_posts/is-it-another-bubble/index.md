The question which is on everyone's mind these days.

I liked [Denise Howell's](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zdnet/Howell/~3/180933354/) take on it..

_"Forget about things like the fact Google's at $741 and Apple's at $191. Were you to try to rent a car at San Jose Airport tomorrow (Wednesday), you would discover that every single vehicle from every single carrier is spoken for."_

And of course who can not resist Billy Joel?
