As a part of the fringe benefits of doing my **FYP** in [I2R](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/), I got to attend many interesting seminars and talks there. Just attended one on Web2.0 today. Very simple, very straight forward, and very interesting.

Reminds me of [a blog post](http://uzyn.com/) from a friend.:p

Wikipedia has a nice [long article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2.0) on it.

A few points I took home.

* All the Web2.0 applications are content driven. The technology allows people to share and access the content easily. It's just the means.
* Lower hardware costs are major driving forces for the Web2.0 'boom'.
* **Mashups** (linking multiple available services to create newer, more useful, services) go a long way.
* Look at alternate sources of revenue.
* Finally, all you need is a simple idea, the technologies and support is there. If you do it right, your start-up can also be bought by Google at $2M+++ ;)

Any Ideas?
