Not that it's new, but [**Google Calendar Beta** ](http://calendar.google.com/)is out. Check it out. Really cool. Some nice features including the ability to share with people; Creating calendars and saving them as files; multiple viewing styles.

The only qualm I have is that it does not work well with [Opera](http://www.opera.com). I hope that changes soon.

What I just found out is that there is a way to sync my favourite desktop calendar, [**Rainlender**](http://www.ipi.fi/~rainy/index.php?pn=projects&project=rainlendar), with Google Calendar. Using the iCal interface avaliable on both I can move events around.

Still a bit buggy, but I am sure Rainy will add Google Calender support soon. Or maybe I should try to hack a calendar application myself, or [extend Rainlender](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/calendar.html).:D

All in due time.
