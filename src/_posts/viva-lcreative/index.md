So I went the latest **Creative Warehouse Sale** last Friday. And I was so excited! All the cool technology for me to touch and feel and listen to! Lemme do a summary of the stuff I saw there.

**-[The X-Fi.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_X-Fi)** Creative's new flagship Sound Blaster. Really cool sound card for the semi-audiophiles out there. Has a really nice upconverting feature. _Upconverts_ from 16bit to 24bit as well as from 2.0 to 5.1! I really wanna know how they do it. I do know though that they need a really poweful DSP (which they sport, something with 10,000 MIPS!) for all the stuff they are doing.

**-[The HQ-2300D](http://sg.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=437&subcategory=438&product=11430).** Really cool headphones. They have their own DAC and Amps in a small little box  That means nicer coupling and better sound! No more "_damn it i bought these cool guy headphones but there is impedence mismatch with my driver._" Also they support Dolby Digital or DTS inputs, by having its own decoder (inside that box)! This guy can optimise your 5.1 DTS or Dolby Digital for a headphone. Kinda like the Holophonic sound thingy. The best part is that if you dont't have 5.1 source, it can upconvert the 2.0 to 5.1 for you, just like the X-Fi!

-[**The Zen Vision M.** ](http://sg.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=14331)Saw the so called iPod killer. Have the agree that the UI is **not** as intutive as the iPod. Took me and TheWeed like 5mins to figure out how to use the scroll pad thingy. Oh and its huge! But still if I ever buy one, might go with Creative. It's the accessories and extra functions. Oh and also the codec support.

**-The Decoders and Mixers.** More like connectivity options for the various Creative devices that people own. Nice ideas, especially the fact that they have so many options.

**-The Creative In-ear headphones.** Keng bought one of those, says they are really as efficient as they promise to be! Have been thinking about those since I heard Robert Heron from DL.TV ranting about it!

**-The Creative Prodikeys and family.** Cool stuff, one day when I know more about music I'll think about these

**-The S$39 1st Gen mp3 players.** Would be fun just to open it up and see whats what!

**-The Creative Webcams.** Going at _insane prices_ !

So what did I buy? **Nothing** :( What do I want? The X-Fi, the HQ-2300D and most importantly a **Job**!! Would be so cool to work with Creative! :D
