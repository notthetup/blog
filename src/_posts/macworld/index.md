I am no Mac user. As a matter of fact, I have only used a Mac once in my life. But, here I am, after a long day of work, at 1am, awake, following the [Wngadget Macworld live feed](http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/).

Apple is doing something right here. [Others](where-creative-fails/) should follow suit.

Apple TV (iTV) is out. What else is in store? Any guesses?

Wait a sec. Just read this.

iPhone is officially out!!. Apple has joined the cellphone wars. This is going be a great year of mobile devices!
