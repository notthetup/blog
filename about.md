ChinPen == Chinmay Pendharkar. And this is my Core Dump. A place to dump my core.

I’m a developer from Singapore. I work with Audio Technologies.

I blog about things that I am interested in and things that excite me. These generally are geeky things like Audio/Acoustics, Web Technologies, Security, Embedded systems and Hardware, and Technology in general. I do blog sometimes about Music, and Food, which are my other passions.

These days since I am involved in local developer community, I tend to blog about that too. Otherwise there’s much musings about life in general. The archives will give you a glimpse in the happenings in the past.
