<p>I am addicted <strong>again</strong>.. .. This time its <em>Piya Bavari Again </em>by Ajay Pohankar. It&#39;s quite the same type of music as <a HREF="http://nttup.blogspot.com/2006/04/addicted.html">Time Traveler</a>, but it&rsquo;s different.</p>

It&rsquo;s same in the sense that is that same fusionistic sound. Lot of synth, a little trance and quite a bit <strong>lounge</strong>, mixed with classical <em>Bandishe</em>s and <em>Thumri</em>s. Makes one amazing combination. Not too classical for those who can&#39;t take it, but classical enough to give it that earthly feel. You have to listen it to really get what I am saying, and unfortunately I can&#39;t help much with that. But <a HREF="http://www.musicindiaonline.com/l/10/s/album.5201/">here </a>is one place you can find the tracks albeit at really crappy quality (only like 20kbps..).</p>
<p>My personal favorite is <em>Payalian Jhankar</em> in raag Puriya Dhanashree. It has some really nice <em>Pakhwaj</em> sounds.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about the artists.. Ajay Pohankar is the main singer and Abhijeet Pohankar (his son) does the music and all the packaging. That makes an interesting team, a classically trained father and a son who&#39;s into contemporary music. Been seeing that a lot these days, and that&rsquo;s good!</p>
<p>This same team had produced a couple of albums before this. I had one of their not-so-famous album.. mostly instrumental (as opposed to this one). But never heard the other <strong>albums</strong>. Now I will have to. Maybe I can get my hands on all the CDs when I go to India! They don&#39;t sell them in Singapore.. :(</p>
