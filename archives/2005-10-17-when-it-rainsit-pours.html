<p>That was the title of a <em>Tabletopic</em> at the last <a href="http://nustm.cjb.net/">NUSTM</a> meeting.</p>
<p>The person who attempted it was unable to speak about it. But I can...</p>
<p>That my life.....:'(</p>
<p>Life was OK last week. Things going on. Slow but steady. And then suddenly <strong>today</strong>, it starts pouring like never.</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
<p>I have like a <strong>million things</strong> to do now and <strong>NO </strong>time.....</p>
<p><strong>I want more time...</strong> Maybe I should try out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">Uberman Sleep</a>. But that would like give me 3-4 hours more per day. Not enuff!!!</p>
<p><strong>How??? Someone help......pls......</strong></p>
<p>On a more natural note about pouring. Its really gonna pour in Singapore for the next month. Thats what the weatherman says....</p>
