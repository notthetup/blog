<p>Wierdly enough, my <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/iphone-the-jack-of-all-trades/">post on the iPhone</a> was published in the <a HREF="http://digital.asiaone.com.sg/news/20070123_001.html">blogosphere</a> section of <a HREF="http://digital.asiaone.com.sg/"> Digital Life</a>.  Digital Life is a suppliment to The Straits Times.</p>
<p STYLE="text-align: center"><a HREF="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~chinpen/TDL.jpg"><img SRC="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/TDL.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="240" /></a></p>
<p>Now, while I am pretty happy with my new found 'fame', I wonder why I was not contacted by  Digital Life regarding this. As a form of basic courtesy, it would be good to just drop an email.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I am fine with people quoting me. But, if you are doing it on a newspaper or some other form of media, than the internet, I would like to know.</p>
<p>And, it seems like <a HREF="http://decayonnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/my-10-second-of-fame.html">other users from ping.sg</a> were also  quoted in that segment! So Digital Life uses <a HREF="http://ping.sg">ping.sg</a> as a source for articles??? Hmm..</p>
