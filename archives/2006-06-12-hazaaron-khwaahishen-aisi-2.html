<p>Hazaaron khwaahishen aisi ke har khwahish pe dam nikle<br />
Bohat niklay mere armaan, lekin phir bhi kam nikle</p>
<p>Nikalna khuld se aadam ka soonte aaye hain lekin<br />
Bahot be-aabru hokar tere kooche se hum nikle</p>
<p>Mohabbat mein nahin hai farq jeenay aur marnay ka<br />
Usi ko dekh kar jeetay hain, jis kaafir pe dam nikle</p>
<p>Hazaaron khwaahishen aisi ke har khwahish pe dam nikle<br />
Bohat niklay mere armaan, lekin phir bhi kam nikle</p>
<p>-Mirza Ghalib (<a HREF="http://www.cedcc.psu.edu/khanjan/Hazaaron.htm">Hazaaron Khwaahishen Aisi</a>)</p>
<p>A crude translation...</p>
<p>Thousands of desires/dreams, each worth dying for.<br />
Many of them I have realized...yet I yearn for more.</p>
<p>We have heard about the dismissal of Adam from Heaven<br />
With a more humiliation, I am leaving the street on which you live.</p>
<p>When in love, there is little difference between life and death<br />
..we live by looking at the infidel for whom we are willing to die</p>
<p>Thousands of desires/dreams, each worth dying for.<br />
Many of them I have realized...yet I yearn for more.</p>
