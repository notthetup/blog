<p>I am searching for a  track from <a HREF="http://www.punditz.com">Midival Punditz</a>. Well it's not really their track, it's by a Swedish group called <a HREF="http://www.sonkite.com/">Son Kite</a>. I have never heard of them, but it seems that they are pretty big in the ethnic+trance type of music. So the Punditz have remixed one of their tracks called <a HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iK6si7Z99E">On Air</a>.</p>
<p>I heard it on the Punditz website, and now I am totally obesssed. Check it out <a HREF="http://www.punditz.com/player_shalom.php">here</a>. It's the first track in the playlist. But it's only like half of the track. :( I want the whole track. And I dun mind buying the CD!</p>
<p>Do you know where I can find it?? Please tell me....</p>
