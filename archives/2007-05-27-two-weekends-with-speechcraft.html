<p>Speechcraft: "<em>Speechcraft is a special program to develop your public speaking abilities. Experienced speakers and communicators present the basics of public speaking in a relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere."</em></p>
<p>I had volunteered to help out in the two sessions of Speechcraft organised by the NUS Toastmasters. Despite being in Toastmasters for 4 years I really suck at it (Easily attributable to my laziness to do projects..), hence I was just helping in facilitating the workshop.</p>
<p>There were two session of speechcraft organised by NUSTM on 12th and 26th of May. The idea was to get some recognition within the NUS community and at the same time help fellow NUS students to start on honing their public speaking skills.</p>
<p>The workshops were aimed at beginners, and thus addressed basic skills like<strong> stage fright, nervousness </strong>and<strong> organisation of your speech</strong>. Some of the senior members of NUSTM were the trainers for the workshop, including <a HREF="http://wekie.wordpress.com/">Weike Tay</a> and <a HREF="http://ericfeng.com/">Eric Feng</a>.</p>
<p>While whole day workshops are tiring, I was very satisfied with what I gained form it. I am not sure how much I helped them, but they surely taught me a couple of things. It's almost ironical but true is most cases. We go in with the expectation of teaching/training people, but end up learning a few lessons ourselves....</p>
<p>Well such is life... Beautiful. :D</p>
