<p>Starbucks stopped serving Rumba Frappuccino's recently. I found out about it while <a HREF="http://www.excalibur-cyberspace.com/peacefulstruggles2">blog hopping</a></p>

<p>Sigh.. one more of my favourites gone... Though I never really liked coffee (<em>addiction is another thing.. I don't drink because I like.. I drink because I need to stay awake</em>), I love Frappuccinos from Starbucks.</p>
<p>I remember the time when I was first introduced to the Fraps.. It was during the 1st 3 months of JC , a class (<em>00S09 from TPJC</em>) outing to PS. One of them recomended me the <strong>Rumba Frap</strong> and the rest is history... Wonder any of them read my blog...:S</p>
<p>I only wish I could have a "Power Rumba Frap" one last time.... Sigh...</p>
