<p>It is said that the best example of a mixed feeling is when :</p>
<div align="center"><em><strong>"your mother-in-law drives your new Alfa-159 over a cliff"</strong></em> </div>
<div align="center">(Personalised for NTT).</div>
<p>For me, this week is as mixed as it can get. On one hand I have<strong> tons</strong> of work to do. On the the other hand <strong>I am going to Pune</strong>! The worst part is that my weekend trip to Pune is not going to help reduce the work that I have to do.....:'(</p>
<p>But then, I get to <strong>meet the cutest girl</strong> in the world....:P:P</p>
<p>Sigh...I dread next week. I am going to <em>drown in work</em>.....</p>
<p>But then, a weekend in Pune would be a refreshing change.....maybe thats what I need....</p>
<p>But, my project mates <strong>aren't going to be too happy</strong> are they??</p>
<p>Thats <strong>mixed feeling</strong> for you..... Bet it cant get worst than that...<strong>can it?</strong></p>
