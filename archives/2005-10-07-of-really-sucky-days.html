<p>*Went to have <em>Dosa </em>for breakfast at engin.....Sold Out.....</p>
<p>*My name was called by one prof. and my test results read out to the whole lecture....:$..paiseh lah..</p>
<p>*<strong>The freaking bus</strong> had to come just then......It's fate I tell U.....</p>
<p>*My favourite headphone muffs decided to die on me today.....</p>
<p>*Found out that I will have to share my Linux machine at I2R with my friend....</p>
<p>*Waited for ISB back from I2R for like 15mins</p>
