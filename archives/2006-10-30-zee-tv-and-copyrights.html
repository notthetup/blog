<p>I am no fan of Indian TV channels. I seldom watch<a HREF="http://www.zeetelevision.com/"> Zee TV</a>, which my parents subscribe to on our Starhub Cable. But, I can't help over-hear it while I am doing something else around the house.</p>
<p>For the last few months I have noticed, the amount of main-stream hindi movie music that is being used in <strong>soaps</strong> and other <strong>adverts</strong> on Zee TV. The reason I am ticked is, it's mostly <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2005/09/28/the-musicthe-magicthe-man/">Rahman</a>'s tunes!</p>
<p>Now, I really really doubt that Zee TV has the rights for all those tunes. Heck, they are not just tunes, but whole tracks! I do remember Zee TV getting sued for copyright infringement when they made a series which was an exact copy of 24, in Hindi. It had some cheesy name with 9/11 in it somewhere.</p>
<p>I can never understand the love for copied <em>'western</em>' stuff that Indian massed have. Everything from music, movies to TV shows is copied and made into a <strong>hindi</strong> version.</p>
<p><em>Watch the original if you love it so much.</em></p>
<p>Wonder if they already have something for <strong>Lost</strong> or <strong>Desperate Housewives</strong> or <strong>CSI</strong>. Actually, I don't want to know.</p>
