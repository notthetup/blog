<p>I have been listening to this one album for a few weeks. I got to know about it on <a href="http://www.musicindiaonline.com/#/album/21-Hindi_Pop/4104-Bageshree/">MIO</a> around 2+ years ago... Seems that one of the tracks was popular in India, and rest were not even know. I had to order it from Canada to LA, and picked it up there in December.</p>

<p>A little about the singer/composer, <strong><a href="http://www.bageshree.com">Bageshree Vaze</a></strong>.</p>
<p>So this lady is, from what I can gather, born in India, and has lived in <strong>Canada </strong>for a long time. Has learnt Indian Classical Music from some great people, and has a lot of music in her family. Oh and she is a classical dancer, which shows in her music. And last but not the least, she is Marathi!!</p>
<p>The thing I like about her music is that it is fresh. You probably have not heard anything like this before. There is some typical <em>raag</em> based vocal improvisation, some dance beats and <em>bols</em>, a lot of western musical structures and instruments. A few synth instruments, and oh ya, really great use of <em><strong>sitar</strong></em>! And her voice, a little rustic, reminds me a little of <strong>Shubha Mudgal</strong>. It goes in very nicely used with the rest of the instruments, especially the synths.</p>
<p>So its kinda <strong>fusionistic</strong>, but I really hate to use that word, cos its been overused. Unfortunaltely, I am a <strong>sucker</strong> for such 'fusionistic' stuff.</p>
<p>Fusionistic?? You know, stuff with some indian instruments (generally for the lead), and western instruments (like for the base). A <em>raag</em> based melody and some other stuff thrown in, like the <em>tabla</em> solos or <em>kathak</em> <em>bols</em> (like in this case) or some vocal improvisations and mixed lyrics in English and some other language.</p>
<p>So I'll run a review of that album in the next week, with some samples that hopefully can get off some place I found long long time ago. Try it out!. Though buying it is gonna be a little difficult, I can lend it to you if you wanna listen.</p>
