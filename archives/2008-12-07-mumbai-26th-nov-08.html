<p>It's really sad that I can blog again about another devastating incident in my beloved city of Mumbai.. The <a href="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2006/07/12/cant-you-do-something-more-creative/">last</a> was when the trains were attacked..</p>
<p>While I still want to say what I said last time, I think this track from A.R. Rahman's from <em>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, </em>I heard today, sums it up just nicely...</p>
<p>The word "<em>Zikr</em>",Â  is supposed to mean the though/rememberance/memory of Allah. But you can think about anything else that incites such devotion/passion/love in you..</p>
<p><em>Ahl-e-talab aja tum ko bulai ahed Allah<br />
Zikr se budh ke nahin hai amal koiee hai farman-e-rasool Allah<br />
Neejaat milti hai unko yaqeenan karein jo qalb se Zikr Allah<br />
Zikr se sur kat-ta hai Nafs ka beshaq Zikr hai saif-ullah</em></p>
<p><em>Zikr aman hai Zikr hai fatah Zikr shifa hai Zikr hai dawa</em><br />
Zikr is Peace...Zikr is Victory...Zikr is Healing...Zikr is the Medicine</p>
<p><em>Har gul mein har rooh mein, har shey mein noor-ullah</em><br />
In every flower... in every soul....in every creation is the Light of Allah<br />
<em>Har dil mein har pal mein reh Zikr-e-illallah</em><br />
May Allah's Zikr stay in every single heart and in every single moment</p>
<p><strong><em>Zikr hai behtar nafrat se; Zikr hai behtar ghaflat se</em><br />
Zikr is better than hatred...Zikr is better than making mistakes..<br />
<em>Zikr hai behtar hujat se; Zikr hai behtar gheevat se</em><br />
Zikr is better than arguments...Zikr is better than backstabbing</strong></p>
