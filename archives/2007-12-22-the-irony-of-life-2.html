<p><em>How I wish I could just be there for you.. How I wish I would make  sure you'd never walk lonely in the car park again.. never shed those tears again... How I wish I could make you stronger.... How I wish I could support you through all this, and not just be an  heartless bystander who watches a tragic  accident on the roadside.... and carries on his journey as if nothing happened.... I care.. I know I do.. I just don't know how much... :(</em></p>
