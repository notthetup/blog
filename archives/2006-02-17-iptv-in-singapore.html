<p>Just saw this on the news yesterday! <a href="http://www.mediacorptv.com/">Mediacorps </a>is starting <strong>IPTV</strong> service in Singapore. That mean you can download your favourite Mediacorps TV shows legally (hehe.. I know) for a small sum of money. Its basically like <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes </a>but for Mediacorps shows.</p>
<p>I think this is really cool. Hopefully if they manage the DRM stuff properly and we can time-shift and place-shift well enough, I can see this technology picking up. Especially since Singapore has so many mobile devices.</p>
<p>But, then again, they could really screw this up. And that will not be a surprise. We have seen it happen before. OK OK I will not complain about stuff... But they should really care about the quality of the videos they are offering. Or maybe a few options for the types of format and size for the user to choose. Also different <strong>DRM</strong> options so we dont have to download the same thing many times. I mean if they are going to get money for it, might as well do it well. I am sure people are willing to pay for it if they provide good service.<strong> I am....Are you??</strong></p>
<p>Currently, I checked the website and the service is beta. Seems that it mostly doesn't work, but you can see the DRM options and costs. 1 episode of <strong>Police and Theif </strong>was <strong>S$3</strong>. Of course single view and the user cannot move the file, which sucks, but for S$3.. hey why not!</p>
<p>I also hope they put up some really cool TV shows from the past. You know like <strong>Under One Roof</strong>! and maybe <strong>PCK</strong>...especially the very first few seasons. Would be really fun to watch them again. For the sake of <a href="http://blog.thewheatfield.org/">TheWeed</a>, I have to mention <strong>Triple 9</strong>! And maybe the really old school stuff like <strong>MDIS</strong>!! and <strong>The RaRa Show</strong>..</p>
<p>Personally, I would do anything to get my hands on the whole season of <strong>Chase</strong>. That was one of the best local show I have watched. It was simple and sweet. OK lah, sometimes a little <em>bo liao</em>, but quite funny! And I guess TheWeed would want the final episode of <strong>Tiramisu</strong> that he missed..</p>
