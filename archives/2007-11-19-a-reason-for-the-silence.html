<p>Bored of seeing the same post on the top of this blog every time you come to check?? So am I... (Although, you should be using <a HREF="http://sweska.net/2006/06/07/hooked-onto-feeds/"> feed readers</a>...)</p>
<p>Anyway, so I am in a nice little fix here..</p>
<p>The nature of my job doesn't allow me to  blog too much about it... That is if I want to keep it.. Which I do... So there goes a huge source of blogging content...</p>
<p>Most of my friends are either bloggers, or have completely no internet life. And hence, posts about events I attend are either posted before I even get to reach home.. or well.. nobody cares if I blogged about certain events...</p>
<p>All my thoughts and ideas about technology are presented on <a HREF="http://www.tech65.org/2007/11/18/65bits-episode-48-once-and-again-the-amazing-tech65/">65Bits</a>.. or other <a HREF="http://www.tech65.org/">Tech65</a> content... and it's really lame to repeat there in a blog post.. So there goes another huge part of my blogging content..</p>
<p>I am also very busy these days with <a HREF="http://www.tech65.org/">Tech65</a> and other projects.... And hence to time to bicker about the smallest things in life... not to mention no time to feel all emo and sad...</p>
<p>Adding the convenience of <a HREF="http://twitter.com/ntt">twitter</a> to this, with the ability to quickly publish single sentence thoughts, doesn't help at all...</p>
<p>So all in all.. the only thing I am finding this blog useful for is <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/08/31/womad-an-audio-tour/">publishing clips of my recordings</a>... that is until I find a <a HREF="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> site to upload whole audio tracks..</p>
<p>Really... I should close down my blog.... I am just too damn lazy...</p>
