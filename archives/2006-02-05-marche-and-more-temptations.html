<p>Went to Marché today.... TheWeed belanjahed us there... :D Thank you dude... It was great...<br />
Though I must say that I dont like Marché. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast! But, I just don't like the concept of the restaurant.. All the food on display, is a huge temptation. I am spoilt for choice when I want to get food. I walk around and around...and I can't decide what I want to get.. Ahhhhhhhh... I hate that feeling...</p>
<p>I have been subjected to many tempations recently...</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://nttup.blogspot.com/2006/01/temptations.html">NUS Arts festival</a>.....music...sound... good stuff....:D</li>
<li>Today's Marche... foood.....</li>
<li>Friend playing/speaking of games... I so wanna play <a href="http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm">civ4</a>...and <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">WoW </a>and I want <a href="http://www.ea.com/official/cc/firstdecade/us/news.jsp">C&amp;C The First Decade</a></li>
<li>Updates and developements by <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/bio/index.html">Lady Ada </a>on <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/index.html">Minty et al</a>.... I wanna make my own mp3 player!!</li>
<li>Geeky stuff on vidcasts like Dl.tv and <a href="http://hak5.org">Hak.5</a>.. I wanna hack into that CVS cam....:D</li>
</ul>
<p>Sigh... how I wish I could don't write this #*@^%@# speech for tomorrow and do one (or more) of these things....</p>
<p>But, I will resist.. and I shall wait. In the words of <a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/thew33d/">TheWeed</a>, "Wait untill time dilates...".....</p>
