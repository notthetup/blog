<p align="left">NTT misses his Alma Mater so much that today he rushed from work, much to the annoyance of colleagues and bosses, and took a 1.5hrs bus ride changing 3 busses to get to his Alma Mater.</p>
<p>A flurry of sms, a quick, lonely dinner and a shuttle bus ride later,  NTT took a cab all the way back home.</p>
<p><strong>NTT really loves NUS and <em>he needs to check his calendar more often</em>.</strong></p>
