<p>They say that "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery" and boy are they right.</p>
<p>Apple took the world by storm with their iPhone at this year's MacWorld and it seems that the  3" touch-screen based hand held devices became "the new black". While I was expecting one or two hand held devices similar to the iPhone, as is the case for the iPods, I was surprised as the devices kept coming. Here is the list until now that I know off.</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nseries.com%2Fn800&amp;ei=J9DaRZzBHoqysALiseWvBg&amp;usg=__RtLLjvohVJXzoB2Rspg5uCgKFNs=&amp;sig2=8lXdYYxMF5EDjFGlMX-0nw">Nokia N800 Internet Tablet.</a> Not exactly a Phone, but I like it for what it does.</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/15/the-lg-ke850-touchable-chocolate/">LG KE850.</a> Very similar as well, but looks 'cheap'.</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/29/meizus-m8-apple-lawyers-start-your-engines/">Meizu M8</a>. Damn too similar to the iPhone. I hope they stay clear of <a HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/">the 200 patents</a>.</p>
<p><a HREF="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/asus-aura-cellphone-concept-imaginary-iphone-challenger-234244.php">Asus Aura Concept Phone.</a> Not too similar, and its still a concept. :(</p>
<p><a HREF="http://samsung.com/PressCenter/PressRelease/PressRelease.asp?seq=20070208_0000320566">Samsung targets Ultra Smart F700.</a> Sweet! I'll take the slide-out qwerty keypad, anytime.</p>
<p>Have you seen more?</p>
