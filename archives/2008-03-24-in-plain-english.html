<p>I saw this video from <a HREF="http://www.geekbrief.tv/">Geekbrief.tv</a>, a podcast which I watch.</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.commoncraft.com/">CommonCraft Productions</a> by Lee and Sachi LeFever is doing a series of Video explaining many of the Web2.0/New Media/Web Technology ideas and concepts like Wikis, Twitter and Blogs "<i>in plain English</i>", with the help of stop motion video made using cardboard cutouts.</p>
<p>There are two things that make it great. The really simple and back to basics way of explaining the concepts, in plain english. And the amazing  stop motion video that accompanies the explaination.</p>
<p>This is the perfect tool to explain to the unenlightened about our "<a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/06/16/is-all-this-just-a-subculture/">subculture</a>". I tried it with my mom. She understood it  well.</p>
