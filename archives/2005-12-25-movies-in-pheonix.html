<p>So I have been laid back for the the past few days...</p>
<p>I was at a friend's in Phoenix, Arizona. It's a nice place. In the middle of the dessert...:p (i wish...)</p>
<p>Anyway, so having nothing much to do than to wander around a bit, we decided to watch some movies...</p>
<p>I manage to watch like 10+ movies in 3 days...</p>
<p>For those interested....</p>
<p>1)Dil Chahta Hai....once again...I had watched like 4 times in 2 days the last time I was in US...:p</p>
<p>2)Kya Cool Hain Hum.... not that cool...</p>
<p>3)Hazaron Khwahishen Aisi.... really brilliant movie...</p>
<p>4)Meenaxi...great music...but not for the non-Lit ppl here....</p>
<p>5)American Born Confused Desi..... there are some really confused ppl here</p>
<p>6)American Chai....OK I guess...But I am not a big fan of tea...</p>
<p>7)Flavours.... Really great ABCD movie...</p>
<p>8)Mein, Meri Bewi, or Woh... Another nice movie... very subtle but makes a lot of impact...</p>
<p>9)Bollywood Hollywood... kinda melodramatic... Not as funny as expected...</p>
<p>10)... Dun remember the rest...</p>
<p>So now.. back to LA....and then to LV...:P:P:P</p>
