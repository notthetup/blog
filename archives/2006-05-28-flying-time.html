<p>It's amazing how time flies . <em>Exams end.. Projects end... Semsters ends... Years end and Eras end.<br />
</em><br />
It's also ironic that I have <strong>not</strong> posted for the last 2-3 weeks just when so many things happened. I'd rather not start on that.</p>
<p>When a chapter ends, another begins. The old chapter should not be delved on for much longer. And the new one, started on as soon as possible....</p>
<p>That reminds me, I have to read<strong> Da Vince Code</strong> before the movie ceases to exist in the theatres!!</p>
