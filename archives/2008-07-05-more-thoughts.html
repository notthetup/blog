<p>As I lie on my bed at 1.17am on this Friday I think....</p>
<p>Is this really how wonderful and amazing love is?? Having some really care and show so much concern about me feels great. But what feels greater is to care of another person this much, and most importantly to do it without any expectations..</p>
<p>That satisfied smile on her face, and the burst of crazy laughter is where I draw my inspiration from.. All I ever want is the smile and the laughter to never leave her..</p>
<p>She asked if this was only this great because it was just a start... I did not have the answer to that.. UB40 said in their song, that Wise men say only fools rush in... Maybe I am a fool... maybe I am falling too deep for my own good.. But then again, if only the mind could control the heart.. But somehow I feel that there is no other way than this... Am I fooling myself by throwing everything I have into this? Maybe.. But I wouldn't have it otherwise.. I do know that there is a finite posibility this won't work.. But this exact moment in life... that smile and the laughter... is worth it all... and more!!</p>
<p>I remember I said this to her once after one of our earlier "date".. that I feel satisfied.. And today I do feel so too... I have no regrets in life.. and if I were to go at this moment... I'd go a happy man.. Satisfied to have brought so much love, motivation, confidence and happiness in her life.. She deserves it all and more..</p>
