<p>OK!<strong> I am back...</strong></p>
<p>Whew....<strong>what a ride!!</strong></p>
<p>3 days, 2 countries, 3 cities, 5 great meals, 6 boring hours in bus and 8 in the plane.</p>
<p>It was really fun though. Got to meet almost all my cousins and relatives since all were invited for my neice's <em>Barsa </em>(naming ceremony). She was named<strong> Tanaya</strong>! And she is very cute. <a HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tanaya/">Take a look. </a></p>
<p>So everyone was saying that <strong>she looks like my mom.</strong> Especially the nose and the cheeks... All I can say that she indeed lacks a 'proper nose' and thus is a member of the "Sans Nose" group of our family! Hehe....</p>
<p>OK! now enough. I should get back to work. There are<strong> heaps and heaps</strong> of it lying before me. :'(</p>
