<p>How I would love to rant about the use of the George Micheal song in some Hindi song!! But I shall not. Not that I like the original, but I don't like blatant copies.</p>
<p>I want to talk about Christmas. Interestingly  enough, I have not been in Singapore for Christmas for many many years. This would probably be my first Christmas in Singapore after 6-7 years. During JC and Seconday school, December was time to go back to India. And generally I came back in January.</p>
<p>The last two years though, it was different. I had very different experiences. Last year, I was in the US during christmas. I visited my Aunt in LA and my other Uncle and his family came down from the Philly as well. It was like a small reunion. We had lots of fun. We made great food, watched a lot of fun TV, chit chatted into the wee hours, and travelled all over the place. The highlight was ofcourse the Turkey dinner on Christmas eve. I remember learning two things, Turkey makes you sleep. Hehe. And cranberry sauce is the best thing ever... ;)</p>
<p>The year before that was a completely different experience. During christmas, I was backpacking in Italy. And on christmas eve I was Rome. I have to say, Christmas period is Italy is not at all how I expected it to be. I was thinking more of like Diwali in India. But it was a very very quiet and calm Rome, that I saw. It was raining heavily, and very few people were on the street. Most of the shops were closed, and there were very few tourists.</p>
<p>I did like that cold, wet and 'closed' Italy somehow. Or maybe it was just the spirit of backpacking. I felt somehow I connected to the place. It was very warm inside and very accomodating. I had some great experiences there, maybe one day I will post some great memories and pictures...</p>
