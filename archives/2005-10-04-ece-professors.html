<p>Today, I am <strong>NOT</strong> going to bitch about the professors from ECE. I think we have had enough of that. Instead,<em> I am going to<strong> praise</strong> them</em> today! <strong>(OMG!! Is that even possible??).</strong></p>
<p>By the grace of god, our department is blessed with a few souls whom I respect with all my heart. How I wish we had more of them....</p>
<p>One of these, is my professor for my EE4**** module from "Communications" concentration. His aim for the course is not to finish the syllabus and satisfy the department guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>He genuinely wants us to learn</strong>.(Isn't that unbelievable??) To ease our pressure and to allow us to understand the subject, he cut down the syllabus vigiorouly (and I mean like by 50%).</p>
<p>Not only that, he <strong>explains things again and again</strong> when we don't get them. For that course, we only get like 10% of the things after the 1st pass. So, that is a great benefit. How I wish <em>some other profs.</em> did that...</p>
<p><strong>Finally, this is what happened today....</strong></p>
<p><em>*I was having dinner with a friend when I feel a tap on my shoulder. </em></p>
<p><em>*I turn around to see my prof!!! </em></p>
<p><em>*Uhh...I blurt out a 'Hi'! (Not very polite I say to myslef)</em></p>
<p><em>*He starts asking me how I was faring me with the module and all.</em></p>
<p><em>*I am soo lost for words. I mean I am so not used to talking casually with profs. (Reminds me of the time when I was in Denmark. There you</em> <em>have to address the profs. by their 1st name. Took me like a whole month to get used to that.)</em></p>
<p><em>*So anyway, the prof. asks me about the last chapter that we studies in the lecture and how I felt about it(It was a tough one). </em></p>
<p><em>*Then he asks if he should revise it with the class so that we can understand it better.</em></p>
<p><em>*I try to give some "pollitically correct" answers. Utterly confused I somehow manage to end the conversation.....</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigh what a ride!!!</strong></p>
<p>Whats worst, is that prof. <strong>thinks </strong>I am really good at this module, since <em>I</em> ask him a lot of 'good' qns and I managed to <em>finish </em>the test in like 1/2 the given time.</p>
<p>Well....here is the truth revealed for you....</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> I hang out this dude who is really good in mathematics and all. He always asks 'good' qns. Not me...I just tag along....<br />
<strong>2.</strong> I blanked out around 1/2 the time through the test....Thus, I stopped writing....I had not finished. I was not even finished in the end...:(</p>
<p>Anyway....<strong>Kudos to you Sir</strong>..... <em>You shall be my vote for the best prof. this sem....</em></p>
