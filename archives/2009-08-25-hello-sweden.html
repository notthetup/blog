<p>I have been in Sweden for the past four days, and I have been really enjoying it. The weather has been amazing, and so have the people. It feel really easy in a country where almost everyone speaks decent English. Most of the signs are in English as well, or can be inferred from Swedish very easily (more on that later).</p>

<p>I've also been meeting many interesting. The current suspects are dutch student, a french teacher, a dutch bagpacker. Hehe. We went out on a day trip to the GÃ¶teborg Archipelago. It was really great weather and interesting company. Although we didn't manage to solve all the worlds problems over the lunch table, we tried.. :P</p>
<p>I'm also enjoying the food here.. My guilty pleasure is the supermarket trip. But, I am trying not to buy too many things for now, since I will be moving into a new place soon. But still I couldn't resist a huge block of Gouda cheese (much to the disappointment of the dutch who don't like their cheese made from pasteurized milk.. ah well)</p>
<p>I have also started a Posterous Travelog at http://chinpen.posterous.com. Do check it out and give comments and suggestion. I would love to interact with all of you during my travels and allow you to see Europe as I see it.</p>
