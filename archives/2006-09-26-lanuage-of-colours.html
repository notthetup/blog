<p>Finally.. I shall soon be <font COLOR="#0000ff"><strong>blue</strong></font>! And that too, without being <font COLOR="#006600"><strong>green</strong></font>! But then, had I  been green, I would have been <font COLOR="#da70d6"><strong>pink</strong></font> by now. In that case though, I would be still <font COLOR="#ffa500"><strong>orange</strong></font> (and blue), unlike the white (in blue) that I am right now!</p>
<p>So what will I be in the future? Orange (and blue) again? Or maybe <font COLOR="#800000"><strong>red</strong></font> (and white). Possibly blue (and red)... Who knows?</p>
<p>Life is full of <strong>colours</strong>.. What are you??</p>
