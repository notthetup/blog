<p>When I last moved, I had complained about how <a href="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2007/04/10/shiftings-a-bitch/">shifting is a bitch</a>. This time however, I am using MANY of the things I mentioned about last time.</p>
<p>1. I am taking MANY days to pack.. I have started sorting almost 2 weeks before.</p>
<p>2. I am not taking MANY MANY things with me. Those will either be stored with a someone in Singapore, or sent to India with parents.</p>
<p>3. I am trashing even more things. This is the big one.. As I keep sorting, I come across many things which have no use now, and will most probably have no use in the future.. So what to do with them?? Trash them!!!</p>
<p>4. Scanning most of the documents I need. Bills, IncomeTax stuff, CFP stuff, financial stuff and all are getting scanned and saved to something like <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>. That way I will have access to them everywhere and not have to lug thick folders around. Now only if I had that <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2009/05/07/scan-to-evernote-fujitsu-scansnap/">Fujitsu ScanSnap</a> scanner..</p>
<p>Hopefully with all this, I should be able to fit everything I need to bring over in the 30Kgs that I am allowed and the box I am going to ship over afterwards. Let's see!!!</p>
