<p>Just realised that today was the<strong> last day of school</strong> for me! Tomorrow's Good Friday and next week is reading week.</p>
<p>And so it ends.... It was the best four years of my life so far.. Learnt so much, got to know so many people, so many things. Feel that I really grew in NUS, in a way.</p>

<p>Parting is painful...sigh.. Gonna miss NUS...</p>
