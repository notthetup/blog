<p>Now, I am 100% sure, working in the<strong> Industry kills every ounce of creavity left inside you</strong>. During my final year at NUS and before I got my job, I was brimming full of <strong><em>Ideas</em></strong>.</p>

<p>My little scribble book was filling up on an almost daily basis with interesting little <strong><em>ideas</em></strong> for small and large projects. Some stuff would be considered innovative, some almost fantastical, but all of it creative in my own sense.</p>
<p>For the last 2 months, I have not touched my scribble book. It sits at the bottom of bag. Holding all the sparksÂ of inspirations..</p>
<p>I  have neither the time to continue developing those <strong><em>ideas</em></strong>, nor am I comming up with new <strong><em>Ideas</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Life has become another mundane chore... Sigh.. To think I actually wanted this....</p>
