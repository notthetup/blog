<p>Esplanade always has a flurry of concerts all throughout the year, and suprisingly many of them are free. Now which part of the deal is not to like? Free.. Great Music.. Amazing Place..I tend to attend many of the free concerts at Esplanade, and last Sunday on the 17th I attended a concert by <a href="http://raghudixit.com/">The Raghu Dixit Project</a>. It was a part of<em> Kalaa Ustsavam</em>, but the desciption of the group got me interested.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The Raghu Dixit Project, a six-member band from India, plays a seamless amalgamation of Indian ethnic music, Indian classical music, Sufi music, and other sounds from around the world."</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fusion</strong>... hehehehe..</p>
<p>So I went there armed with my H4 again.. and here is what I heard..</p>

<p>I loved the sound of the band. Very unique combination of folk, traditional Indian sounds with drums, base, and great vocals.. The violin-guitar duet (Jithin's First Flight) was the most amazing track of the lot, with great solo pieces by both artists.</p>
<p>The H4 peaked most of the time, and I should have really reduced the sensitivity, but I forgot. Hence the 2nd track distorts all over and I had to cut it.. Ooops..</p>
<p>But it was a great evening.. Esplanade... Lovely sounds.. and a great recording.. :)</p>
