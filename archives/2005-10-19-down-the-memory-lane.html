<p><strong>Update :</strong> Found the <a href="http://www.carnatic.com/www/index.php?content_id=1065">lyrics for Mile Sur Mera Tumhara</a>... So now you can sing along in<strong> ALL</strong> the languages too!!!</p>
<p>I should try to learn that, then I can say at least one phrase in each of the languages.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was surfing around when I bumped into these. Stuff that used to be on TV when I was in India. This is pure <strong>Nostalgia....</strong></p>
<p>Really brought back many many memories. The TV shows that I used to watch. They had this one called "Giant Robot". Found out that it was actually called "Johnny Sokko and his Amazing Flying Robot!". Found some <a href="http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/356.html">description and pics here</a></p>
<p>Then there was "The Jungle Book" dubbed in Hindi. The best part was the title song. It went something like, "<em>Chaddi pahen ke phool khila hai phool khila hai</em>" Rough translation is, "A <strong>shorts wearing</strong> flower has bloomed "... :S:S. Cant seem to find much about it. The names of the characters were changed though. Some of them were hillarious.</p>
<p>And then there were these animations. They were like PSAs but just look at the quality of animation. Just <strong>soo cool</strong> that one can still find them still. This one: <a href="http://www.rajiv.com/india/humor/anek.aspx?quality=better">Ek, Anek and Ekta </a>was very pupolar...</p>
<p>Who can forget the songs about multicultural unity. It was so fun to hear all the <strong>various languages from India</strong>, see all the famous people on TV. I'd wait untill they sang in<strong> Marathi</strong> and get really excited. Unfortunately, I can't seem to get the videos. <strong>If anyone has them, please contact me.</strong> Would really like to see them again....</p>
<p>I found Mile Sur Mera Tumhara and Baje Sargam <strong>originals on mp3s</strong> though. Thanks to the guys at "<a href="http://www.rtpdesis.com/">Rtp Desis</a>"..</p>
<p>And finally, this <strong>hillarious remake</strong> of Mile Sur Mera Tumhara by people from <strong>MIT.</strong> Its awesome. Man ....do these people ever work??</p>
<p>And by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgnMa64ZIGQ">students of UTA</a>....<strong>this one is cooler</strong>...I think...</p>
<p>Njoy...</p>
