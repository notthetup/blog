<p>After my 6 months exchange stint in Copenhagen, Denmark, I <del>was</del> am completely in love with Europe. The <em>charming cities, breathtking landscapes and lovely people</em> are absolutely unique and just never enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nttup/110858334/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" title="110858334_f0504e05f7_m" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/110858334_f0504e05f7_m.jpg" alt="110858334_f0504e05f7_m" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>While I have travelled around Europe many times, I was too young and too "blur" too remember and understand anything, except the last two trips which were during my under-grad years as Exchange. And that was when I found out about the best way to travel and explore any new land. <strong>Bagpacking</strong>.. A roadtrip up to Norway and bagpacking adventure down in Italy sold me to this idea..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nttup/2357780133/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" title="2357780133_1b6a3f6c84_m" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/2357780133_1b6a3f6c84_m.jpg" alt="2357780133_1b6a3f6c84_m" width="240" height="156" /></a></p>
<p>There is something about <em>getting lost in a new city. Wandering through the small little alleys, walking into the quaint corner cafes, enjoying a cup while watching an old man, a regular, come in, and stand silently by the bar and get his personalised cup, and leave without a word being said.</em></p>
<p>And now Europe beckons me again.<strong> Paris, Wien, Warsaw, Strasbourg, Zaragosa, Copenhagen, Florence, Belfast, Munich, Prague, Milan, Moscow, Edinburgh...</strong></p>
<p>OH and not to forget Amsterdam for<a href="http://thenextweb.org/2008/02/22/diggnation-live-at-the-next-web-conference-in-amsterdam/"> live Diggnation on the 3rd April</a>..</p>
<p><strong>Europe beckons.. and I will go.. :)</strong></p>
