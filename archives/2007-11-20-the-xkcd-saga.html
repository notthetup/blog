<p>This is my latest addiction on the Internet.. <a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd</a>..</p>
<p>It's one of the geekiest web-comic around.. touching stuff from programming, to mathematics, geek community, love and life.. and a great attitude. And what wins me, is the ability of the author to make obscure references to seemingly unrelated things.. and still make it funny...</p>
<p>But the latest set of comics, 1337, has to be the best comics strip mini-series in my reading... It has references to the some of the greatest geeks and hackers around.. as well as some of the most controversial issues in technology.. plus the attitude..</p>
<p>Here they are.. in sequence.. including one more, which seems like a pre-lude to the 1337 series... (Hint: The name of the son...)</p>
