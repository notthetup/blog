<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>Much to the delight of my Mother, I have decided to go for my Commencement. The last straw was when some friends decided to <strong>outcast</strong> me, for planning to not attend the Commencement, from right now! Sigh... friends I have...</p>
<p>On the brighter side.. There is gonna be <em>free food</em>!!!!</p>

<p><strong>To Commence or not to Commence that is the question.</strong></p>
<p>I am in a dilema. I don't want to go for my Commencement. But I do.. :S</p>

I feel that Commencement ceremonies/ Convocations and all similar things are just a way to show off your acheivements. It's like a time to go up on the stage and say, <em>'Look I am so smart, I graduated from NUS!</em>'.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that there is no great acheivement in graduating from NUS. It's not that big a deal and really... anybody can do it. So what's there to show off? And in anycase I don't like showing off. Plus, its really lame to wait like 3 hours just to go up get a fake certificate and smile while your photo is being taken. The worst of all is the fact that <strong>CPE</strong> is like the last few course to have convocation. Its like 8pm on 13th June!!</p>
<p>But I really want to go for mt Commencement ceremony. That's possibly the last time I'll get to meet <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/commencement/">so many of my friends</a>. It will be fun hanging out, wearing <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/commencement/2010/types.php">stupid gowns </a>and making fun of each other. I am already missing NUS and the people. This will be one chance to go back to NUS and meet so many..</p>
<p>Sigh.. I have to decide by the end of next week... Help please..</p>
