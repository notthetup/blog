<p>I am going to use this blog to update the things I encounter and learn during the last few months of my two projects on Acoustics.&nbsp;The main idea is behind this is to verbalize my thinking so that I get to distil my thoughts and at the same time save them for future reference..</p>
<p>This will definitely get pretty technical with maths, engineering, signal processing programming and other types of ideas. I appologize in advance if you get bored and if it doesn't make sense (but please do comment, and I will try to explain).. One of the hopes of this blog is to be distil the concepts (through discussion) to allow anyone and everyone to understand what I am doing.</p>
<p>The two projects I am working on right now are,</p>
<ol>
<li>Investigation of Ground Burried Resonators (GBR) as a method for reducing outdoor sound propagation.</li>
<li>Auralization of a City Bus Passage.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will post more information about both the projects as we go along. Please feel free to comment and ask questions.</p>
<p>Thanks for following and the comments!</p>
