<p>Maybe because I have nothing better to do, but during the past week , it seems like I had quite a few brushes with the <strong>memory lane</strong>.</p>
<p>I found my old 'collections' folder in at the bottom of bookshelf. It has like a lot of old new-paper cuttings. I used to cut this article about <strong>geograhpy</strong> every week. Ironically, I never took geography for O levels..</p>

<p>I also found my autograph of <em>Aishwarya Rai</em>, that was taken at Orchard road..:)</p>

<p>I also dug up the <em>old storage box</em> from the store. I needed to clean it and put some NUS stuff in it. But I ended up looking at the contents and remembering old times for the whole day...</p>
<p>I found old school magazines. School photos..</p>

I found my old music book..</p>
<p>"  <em>Chan mali chan, chan mali chan,<br />
Chan mali chan, ketipung payung.</em>"</p>
<p>And the icing on the cake was when I visited Far Horizon Gardens after so many years!!..</p>
<p>I have so many memories of that place. All the events.. all the people...</p>
<p>I love to keep old things. They bring back memories. They let you touch your   own past and bring you back to your childhood.</p>
<p><strong>I miss those childhood</strong> <strong>days</strong>. Not a care in the world!!</p>
