<p>I never figure out whether I like holidays or hate them!!</p>
<p>I mean its all nice to be free and stuff, but its soooo boring. I mean you do all the standard holiday activities for like a week or two...and then what???<strong> Holidays are boring....</strong></p>
<p>Whats worst is this holidays that I am havings. It's not boring but it is driving me crazy. For once, I have planned a trip to go overseas during the holidays with my family. Now, this will drive some people crazy with jealousy, but I am not feeling anything closed to satisfaction or content or for that matter happiness.</p>
<p>On the other hand I am feeling very <strong>conscious</strong> of the fact that I am leaving my undone FYP behind to '<em>waste time</em>'. There is a lot of work to be done and there are important deadlines in January. Sigh....</p>
<p>But I can't cancel the trip because its gonna be wonderful(I get to meet many cousins, aunts and uncles and old friends) and also cos I have already <strong>paid</strong> for it....</p>
<p>Now, I wish that the holidays ceased to exit and we could work all year round...</p>
<p>OK. Blast me all you want, but this is how I feel......</p>
