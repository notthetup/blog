<p><strong>The Spaniards</strong></p>
<p>Spanish do not have red blood. Their blood is purple. It's not blood but kalimotxo</p>
<p>Milk and Cookies is the official breakfast/lunch/dinner menu of <strike>Zaragosa</strike> Zaragoza.</p>
<p>Side ponytails are the latest fashion trend Spain.</p>
<p>A typical spanish day takes place as follows:<br />
<em>12pm.</em> Wake up<br />
<em>1pm.</em> Breakfasy (Milk and Cookies)<br />
<em>2pm.</em> Siesta<br />
<em>3pm.</em> Lunch (Spinach and Cream OR Milk and Cookies)<br />
<em>4pm-5pm.</em> Wasting some time with other Spanish<br />
<em>6pm-7pm.</em> Deciding where to go for party tonight.<br />
<em>8pm-9pm.</em> More wasting away.<br />
<em>10pm.</em> A quick hurried dinner. (Possibly, Milk and Cookies)<br />
<em>11pm-3/4am.</em> Party!!<br />
<em>4/5am.</em> Another round of Milk and Cookies (if sober enough to find the milk).<br />
<em>5am-12pm.</em> Sleep.</p>
<p>The Spanish have a special ability of 'Finding' things.</p>
<p>Intrestingly, many other people, develope an ability of loosing things when the Spanish are around.</p>
<p>In Spain one cannot be sure if there is a "ban on the van", or "van on the ban".</p>
<p>All Spanish are consevationist. They conserve (reuse) cooking oil.</p>
<p>Spanish also come in many flavours.<br />
