<p>So....my Canon digi-cam was screwed.. For some reasons, since like 2 weeks ago, it started showing me a <strong>blank screen</strong>. The menu could be seen but nothing from the lens. The pictures that I took also turned out to be blank. Seemed like a CCD problem.</p>
<p>
But because it was <a href="http://nttup.blogspot.com/2005/11/its-that-time-again.html">"That time of the year"</a> I did to try to get it repaired untill today. I was also a bit hesitant since the warranty was only untill last month. The cam is freaking cheapo, din wanna spend like 1/2 its price for repairs. </p>
<p>Actually I had heard something about many cam companies calling back their cams for damaged CCDs. But hadn't heard about Canon.</p>
<p>Anyways, so I go to Canon Service and Repair today. Its at Harbour Front. This is how it went...:P</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Umm... The problem with this cam is that it...</p>
<p><strong>Lady at the counter (LATC):</strong> Has a blank screen?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Umm Ya! <em>(How does she know??)</em></p>
<p><strong>LATC:</strong> OK. Its a CCD problem. We'll repair it for you <strong>FoC</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> OK! Thats Cool.</p>
<p><strong>LATC:</strong> Oh, but we dont have the stock for the CCDs. They wont be arriving till <strong>January.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Oh!<em> (Damn it...that means I need to buy a new cam for the trip in Dec???..)</em></p>
<p><strong>LATC:</strong> But, we will <strong>loan you a camera</strong> till then!</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Huh?? Really??<em>(Oooops did I just say that??)</em> Cool!</p>
<p><strong>LATC:</strong> Just fill this up...</p>
<p><em>(Followed by lots of paper work. How I wish they have some kinda RFID/NFC tech to grab all my usefull data that I authorize....:P:P)</em></p>
<p><strong>LATC:</strong> Since you had a A310, and thats out of production, we will loan you a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/powershot_a_series/powershot_a410">A410</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> OK!! <em>(Yipeee!!!)</em></p>
<p><em>(A lot more paper work)</em></p>
<p><strong>LATC:</strong> Ok. Here is your new cam. Thanks. We'll sms you when your cam is ready. Just bring back this cam as it is</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Sure. Thanks.... <em>(Smirks...)</em></p></p>
<p>Seems like its a very common problem. Saw a lot of people carry away replacement cams. <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/146/3348/1024/IMG_0008s.jpg">Here is the notice </a>that Canon has given me. Seems like really a lot of people affected.</p>
<p>So if you own a Canon cam. Check if you can get the CCD replaced. Its only untill <strong>31st Dec 2005</strong>.</p>
<p>I have to agree that the customer service is great. Reminds me of Fujitsu in a way...</p>
<p>I just I have one question for them... <strong>Can I keep it???...pls pls pls.....</strong></p></p>
