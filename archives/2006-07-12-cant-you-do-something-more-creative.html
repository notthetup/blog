<p>I am absolutely shocked by the developement in Mumbai. Though I never actually lived in Mumbai, something makes it quite dear to me. Maybe the amount of time I spent there, maybe the number of people I know from there or maybe just that it's capital of Maharashtra...</p>
<p>What saddens me more are the number of lives lost, all innocent people. Mostly middle-class workers returning from their jobs. Working hard all day, in Mumbai, to earn an honest living for their families. And also that I knew at least one of them.</p>
<p>There is no way to justify killing of such innocent people. What had they specifically done such that they deserved such wrath from the assilants??</p>
<p>This rant can go on forever, but for now all I want so say is, 'Can't you do something more creative?'. Instead of spreading destruction, chaos, and disorder, do something better. Create something, organise something good, do something worthwhile.</p>
<p>I don't understand how there people have so much time to plan and coordinate such thing and I can't even find time to make minty! Do something creative people, don't waste your life away... Please..</p>
