<p>Last year in March, I blogged about <a href="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2008/03/25/europe-beckons/">wanting to to go Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Europe has always charmed me with it's culture, it's people, the food (especially the food) and the way people think. It might not be the best place on earth, but I do like it quiet a bit.</p>
<p>Having had a great exprience during my exchange days in Denmark, I have decided to go back to Europe for further studies. I will be studying Sound and Vibration, at the Chalmers University in Goteborg, Sweden.</p>
<p>I've always loved to study. My days at NUS were some of the best till then. I am hoping to learn and explore even more things in another area of my interest while I am there in Sweden. Hopefully it will open many news avenues and give me many new opportunies in the next few years.</p>
<p>So yes, a new chapter to my life will start in about a month's time. It's a two year course and so I'll be Goteborg for next two years... :)</p>
<p><em>P.S. If you're gonna be in that part of the world, just drop me an email/im and we can surely meetup.. :)</em></p>
