<p><strong>This absolutely sucks....</strong></p>
<p>I was not feeling so well, so I decided to sleep early today!!  I have been sleeping pretty late for the past week, so this is like a big deal.</p>
<p>I try to sleep and<strong> I cant seem to fall asleep!!....Ahhhhhhhhhhh</strong></p>
<p>Was tossing and turning for an hour. So I decided to listen to some music to help me sleep...</p>
<p>Thats when I realised that I had left my <a href="http://nttup.blogspot.com/2005/10/headphones-for-dogsand-whales.html">headphones </a>at home! Man....</p>
<p>So I listened to an<a href="http://podcasts.engadget.com/"> Engadget podcast</a>....Though listening to all that tecky stuff would 'bore' me to sleep.....But guess what.....now I am more awake than before!</p>
<p>And I hate this state. My brain seems to be needing the sleep. It's like working at 50%. But my body <em>does not</em> wanna sleep.....</p>
<p>Sigh...I think I'll just blog some great link that I found....</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Ever wanted to own a <a href="http://hackaday.com/2005/10/31/cheap-compound-microscope/">microscope</a>?? I rem I used to have one, but this one is way cooler...</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> "<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000157064967/">PodLocker </a>promises security, delivers torn pants..."</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000540064976/">Smart Fire Alarm</a>....Is it me or do you think that the neural network is a bit of an overkill????</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000153065036/">A tea serving robot</a>!!! Man...wastage of technology.....</p>
