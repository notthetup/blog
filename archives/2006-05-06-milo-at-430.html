<p>Yup its 5am on a Saturday morning. I have no exams, school, work or anything.. But I am up..</p>
<p>Sigh. I kinda skipped dinner yesterday and was too sleepy to think about supper. And now like 3 hours after I slept, I wake up with crazy nightmares in my head.(I dont even wanna go there). So I decided that I was hungry and decided to grab some Milo from the vending machines and a granola bar.</p>
<p><a href="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/milo-can.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" title="milo-can" src="http://chinpen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/milo-can.jpeg" alt="" width="85" height="150" /></a><br />
So I went walking around PGP at 430am, in my PJs, half-asleep looking for <strong>Milo</strong>. And <strong>NO</strong> freaking vending machines in PGP have any freaking drinks left in them.. And I mean <strong>NONE</strong>. I walked around for 30mins looking for some drink and returned <em>empty handed</em>.</p>
<p>What does a man have to do here to get a Milo??</p>
