<p>Life has always been very ironic for me. Screwing my <strong>every</strong> plan and ambition. And it happens again..</p>
<p>I quote <a HREF="http://nttup.wordpress.com/2006/07/22/of-all-things-visual/">myself</a>, "<em>I have decided not to replace it. At least for the next few months. I donâ€™t plan to go on any trips, I am low on savings and I will be pretty busy once I get a job..</em>"</p>
<p>Hehe, I just had to say that, and now <strong>suddenly</strong> there are 2 possibilities of 'trips' in the next 2 months. And I really should have a camera for those.</p>
<p>So now I am back shopping for a camera.. Nothing too expensive and big though. Like I said before, I suck at photography and I can't be bothered..:p</p>
<p>Any recomendations? My friend was recomending the Canon A430..</p>
